# Grading Fixes - October 10, 2025

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Grading Happens Too Late
**Problem:** Grading started AFTER user lands on loading page, causing long wait

**Solution:** Grading now triggers immediately when session ends
- Modified `app/api/session/route.ts` PATCH endpoint
- Fires grading API call in background (fire-and-forget)
- Loading page just polls for completion

**Before:**
```
End Session → Redirect to Loading → Wait 1s → Poll → Find Transcript → Trigger Grading → Wait 10-15s
```

**After:**
```
End Session → Save Transcript + START GRADING → Redirect to Loading → Grading Already Running → Show "Analyzing..."
```

**Result:** User sees "Analyzing conversation..." immediately with accurate progress

### Issue #2: Session Didn't Grade (All 0%)
**Possible Causes Investigated:**

1. **Transcript Not Captured**
   - Check: Did conversation happen?
   - Check: Browser console for transcript logs
   - Check: `full_transcript` column in database

2. **Grading API Not Called**
   - Check: Server logs for "🎯 Starting grading"
   - Check: Background grading trigger in PATCH logs
   - Check: Loading page logs

3. **OpenAI API Failed**
   - Check: `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable set
   - Check: OpenAI API quota/billing
   - Check: Network connectivity

4. **Database Migration Not Applied**
   - Check: Score columns exist
   - Check: Run diagnostic query (see below)

---

## 🧪 Diagnostic Tools

### Check Most Recent Session

```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  created_at,
  ended_at,
  jsonb_array_length(full_transcript) as transcript_lines,
  overall_score,
  sale_closed,
  virtual_earnings,
  analytics->>'grading_version' as grading_version,
  jsonb_array_length(analytics->'line_ratings') as lines_graded
FROM live_sessions 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

### Run Diagnostic Script

```bash
# Check specific session:
node scripts/diagnose-grading-failure.js [session-id]

# Or check most recent:
node scripts/diagnose-grading-failure.js
```

### Manual Grading Test

```bash
# Get session ID from database, then:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/grade/session \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sessionId":"YOUR-SESSION-ID-HERE"}'
```

---

## ✅ What to Check in Browser Console

When you end a session, you should see these logs:

### 1. Session End Logs
```
🛑 endSession() called
🛑 Ending session: [session-id]
📊 Transcript to save: X lines
📊 Transcript content: [array]
```

### 2. PATCH Request Logs
```
🔧 PATCH: Updating session: [session-id]
📝 PATCH: Transcript lines: X
⏱️ PATCH: Duration: X seconds
📝 PATCH: Formatted transcript sample: {...}
✅ PATCH: Session updated successfully
🎯 PATCH: Triggering background grading
```

### 3. Loading Page Logs
```
🔍 Loading page: Session check
  has_transcript: true
  transcript_length: X
  has_analytics: false (initially)
  has_line_ratings: false (initially)
```

### 4. After ~10-15 seconds
```
✅ Grading complete! Redirecting to analytics...
```

## 🚨 Common Problems & Solutions

### Problem: "No transcript to grade" Error

**Symptoms:**
- All scores are 0%
- Analytics page shows no data
- Server logs show "❌ No transcript found"

**Causes:**
1. No conversation occurred (session ended immediately)
2. Transcript capture failed (ElevenLabs issue)
3. PATCH request failed

**Fix:**
1. Check browser console during session for transcript logs
2. Verify ElevenLabs connection (look for "✅ WebRTC Connected!")
3. Check PATCH logs in server console

---

### Problem: "OpenAI API key not configured" Error

**Symptoms:**
- Grading never completes
- Server logs show "❌ OPENAI_API_KEY not configured"
- Loading page times out

**Fix:**
```bash
# Add to .env.local:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...your-key...

# Restart dev server:
npm run dev
```

---

### Problem: Grading Times Out (30s)

**Symptoms:**
- Loading page redirects after 30 seconds
- Analytics shows 0% scores
- No error in console

**Causes:**
1. OpenAI API slow response
2. Transcript is very long (>5000 words)
3. OpenAI rate limit hit

**Fix:**
1. Check OpenAI API status
2. Reduce transcript length if needed
3. Wait a moment and try manual grading

---

### Problem: Grading Returns Partial Data

**Symptoms:**
- Some scores populate, others are NULL
- Some sections missing (earnings, objections, etc.)

**Causes:**
1. OpenAI hit token limit (max_tokens: 4000)
2. Prompt too complex for response
3. JSON parsing failed

**Fix:**
1. Check server logs for full OpenAI response
2. May need to increase max_tokens
3. Check for JSON parsing errors

## 🔍 Enhanced Logging

I've added extensive logging to help debug:

### Session PATCH Endpoint
- ✅ Logs transcript length
- ✅ Logs formatted transcript sample
- ✅ Logs grading trigger success/failure
- ✅ Warns if no transcript

### Grading API Endpoint
- ✅ Logs session fetch
- ✅ Logs transcript validation
- ✅ Logs OpenAI call start
- ✅ Logs formatted transcript preview
- ✅ Logs OpenAI response
- ✅ Logs full grading result
- ✅ Logs extracted scores
- ✅ Logs earnings/deal details
- ✅ Logs database update
- ✅ Detailed error logging with stack traces

### Loading Page
- ✅ Logs session polling results
- ✅ Logs transcript status
- ✅ Logs analytics status
- ✅ Logs grading completion
- ✅ Shows errors in UI

## 🎯 Testing the Fixes

### Test Grading Flow:

1. **Start dev server with logging:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Keep this terminal visible!

2. **Open browser console** (F12)

3. **Start a training session**
   - Go to `/trainer`
   - Have a conversation (at least 5 exchanges)
   - Watch console for transcript logs

4. **End the session**
   - Click "End Session"
   - Watch server terminal for PATCH logs
   - Should see "🎯 PATCH: Triggering background grading"
   
5. **On loading page**
   - Should immediately show "Analyzing your conversation with AI..."
   - Status dot should be purple and pulsing
   - Wait ~10-15 seconds

6. **Auto-redirect to analytics**
   - Should see all data populated
   - Earnings breakdown
   - Objection analysis
   - Coaching plan
   - Enhanced transcript

## 🐛 If It Still Doesn't Work

### Step 1: Check Environment Variables
```bash
# Verify these are set:
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
echo $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
```

### Step 2: Check Server Logs
Look for these errors:
- "❌ OPENAI_API_KEY not configured"
- "❌ Session not found"
- "❌ No transcript found"
- "❌ Grading error"

### Step 3: Check Database
```sql
-- Get session ID from URL, then:
SELECT 
  id,
  full_transcript,
  analytics,
  overall_score
FROM live_sessions 
WHERE id = 'YOUR-SESSION-ID';
```

### Step 4: Manual Grading
If session has transcript but no scores:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/grade/session \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sessionId":"YOUR-SESSION-ID"}'
```

### Step 5: Check OpenAI Response
Look in server logs for:
```
✅ OpenAI grading complete: {...}
📊 Full grading result: {...}
```

If missing, OpenAI call failed.

## 📊 What Should Happen

### Immediately when session ends:
- ✅ Transcript saved to database
- ✅ Background grading starts
- ✅ Redirect to loading page
- ✅ Loading shows "Analyzing conversation..."
- ✅ Purple pulsing dot

### During loading (10-15 seconds):
- ✅ OpenAI processes conversation
- ✅ Calculates all scores
- ✅ Generates coaching plan
- ✅ Saves to database
- ✅ Loading page polls and detects completion

### After grading complete:
- ✅ Loading shows "Grading complete!"
- ✅ Auto-redirect to analytics
- ✅ All sections populated with data
