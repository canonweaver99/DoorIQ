# Eye Contact: The Window to Trust
**Estimated read: 3 minutes**

Eye contact builds trust, shows confidence, and creates connection. But too much eye contact feels intense, and too little feels shifty. Get it right, and you'll build instant rapport.

## The 60-70% Rule

Maintain eye contact 60-70% of the time. Less than that, you look shifty or dishonest. More than that, you look intense or creepy. Find the balance.

## When to Make Eye Contact

**Make eye contact when:**
- Introducing yourself
- Making key points
- Asking for the sale
- Responding to objections
- Showing you're listening

**Break eye contact when:**
- Thinking (look up or to the side)
- Explaining something complex (look at your materials)
- Transitioning between topics (brief glance away)

## The Triangle Technique

Don't stare at their eyes the whole time. Instead, look at their eyes, then their mouth, then back to their eyes. This creates a natural, comfortable gaze pattern.

## Cultural Considerations

Different cultures have different eye contact norms. In some cultures, direct eye contact is seen as aggressive. In others, avoiding eye contact is seen as dishonest. Read the situation and adjust.

## Building Trust Through Eye Contact

When you make eye contact while making a promise or guarantee, it shows sincerity. When you make eye contact while asking for the sale, it shows confidence. When you make eye contact while listening, it shows respect.

## The Power of the Pause + Eye Contact

Combine a strategic pause with direct eye contact. This creates anticipation and shows confidence. Try it right before asking for the sale.

## Common Mistakes

**Staring:** Too much eye contact feels intense. Break it occasionally.

**Avoiding:** Too little eye contact feels shifty. Make more eye contact.

**Looking down:** Looking down while speaking shows lack of confidence. Look up or straight ahead.

**Looking away during objections:** Maintain eye contact when they object. It shows you're listening and taking them seriously.

## Practice Exercise

Practice maintaining eye contact in everyday conversations. Notice how it feels. Notice how others respond. Get comfortable with it so it feels natural in sales situations.
