# Energy Matching: Finding Their Frequency
**Estimated read: 3 minutes**

Energy matching is about meeting people where they are, then gradually leading them to where you want them to be. Match their energy level, then raise it slightly to create engagement.

## What is Energy Matching?

Energy matching means matching their enthusiasm, pace, and overall vibe. High-energy homeowner? Match that energy. Low-energy homeowner? Match that calm. Then gradually adjust to create the energy level you need for the sale.

## The Matching Phase

Start by matching their energy exactly. If they're calm and measured, be calm and measured. If they're excited and energetic, be excited and energetic. This creates rapport and makes them feel understood.

**Key Rule:** Match first, then lead. Don't try to force high energy on someone who's low energy. It won't work.

## The Leading Phase

Once you've matched their energy and built rapport, gradually raise your energy level. Increase your enthusiasm slightly. Speed up your pace a bit. Show more passion. They'll naturally follow you up.

## Reading Energy Levels

**High Energy:** Fast speech, animated gestures, lots of movement. Match this, then maintain it.

**Medium Energy:** Normal pace, moderate gestures, balanced. Match this, then raise it slightly.

**Low Energy:** Slow speech, minimal gestures, reserved. Match this, then gradually increase.

**Negative Energy:** Defensive, closed off, skeptical. Match their energy level, but keep your body language open and positive.

## When Energy Matching Goes Wrong

**Too much energy:** If you're way more energetic than they are, you'll overwhelm them. Dial it back.

**Too little energy:** If you're way less energetic than they are, you'll bore them. Dial it up.

**Forcing energy:** Don't try to force high energy on someone who's clearly low energy. Match first, then lead.

## The Transition

The transition from matching to leading should be gradual. Don't suddenly jump from low energy to high energy. Gradually increase your pace, volume, and enthusiasm over the course of the conversation.

## Energy and Objections

When they raise an objection, match their energy level. If they're calm, stay calm. If they're frustrated, acknowledge that frustration with matching energy, then gradually bring them back to a more positive state.

## Practice Exercise
