# Reading and Adjusting
**Estimated read: 3 minutes**

Not every customer needs the same pitch. Read their engagement and adjust your delivery accordingly.

Reading body language tells you everything. Arms crossed? They're defensive—slow down, build more rapport. Leaning in? They're engaged—go deeper, show more value. Looking away? They're disengaged—keep it short, hit high points. Checking their phone? They're distracted—wrap it up or re-engage with a question. Body language doesn't lie. Read it and respond.

Adjusting depth based on engagement is crucial. High engagement means they're asking questions, nodding, leaning in. Go deeper. Show more value. Build more desire. Low engagement means they're checking their phone, looking away, giving one-word answers. Keep it short. Hit the high points. Get to the close faster. Medium engagement means they're listening but not excited. Find what matters to them. Ask "What's your biggest concern?" Then tailor your pitch to that specific concern.

Mirroring their energy creates connection. Low energy customer? Match their calm delivery. Don't be overly enthusiastic—it feels fake and pushy. High energy customer? Match their excitement. Don't be monotone—it feels boring and disengaged. When you match their energy, you create rapport. When you don't, you create disconnect.

When to speed up vs slow down depends on their signals. Rushing signals? Speed up. Get to the point. They're busy. Curious signals? Slow down. Go deeper. They want to know more. Impatient signals? Speed up and close. Engaged signals? Slow down and build value. Read the room and respond.

If they're not listening, stop talking and ask a question. Don't keep pitching to someone who's tuned out. Re-engage them. "Does that make sense so far?" or "What questions do you have?" or "What matters most to you?" Questions require answers. Answers require engagement. Engagement requires listening.

The "gut check" mid-pitch works because it gives you feedback. "Does that make sense so far?" tells you if they're following. "What questions do you have?" tells you what they care about. "What matters most to you?" tells you what to focus on. Use these checks to adjust your pitch in real-time.

When to pivot topics entirely happens when they don't care about what you're saying. They don't care about price? Pivot to safety. They don't care about features? Pivot to convenience. They don't care about savings? Pivot to peace of mind. Find what they care about and talk about that instead.

Upper class vs middle class vs elderly requires different approaches. Upper class wants quality and exclusivity. Middle class wants value and reliability. Elderly wants simplicity and trust. Adjust your language, your examples, your focus. One pitch doesn't fit all demographics.
