# Building Value Before Price
**Estimated read: 3 minutes**

Price is the last thing they should think about. If you're talking price before they understand value, you've already lost.

The golden rule: never mention price until they're ready to hear it. Price without value feels expensive. Price with value feels like a bargain. Your job is to build so much value that when you finally mention price, they're surprised it's so low, not so high.

Why leading with price kills the conversation is simple: price is an objection waiting to happen. When you lead with price, they're thinking "That's too much" before they even know what they're buying. When you lead with value, they're thinking "I need this" before they even know what it costs. The difference determines whether you close or get rejected.

Value must outweigh cost in their mind before you quote anything. They need to see the problem clearly. They need to understand the solution deeply. They need to feel the benefit emotionally. Only then can they process price rationally. Until then, price is just a number that sounds too high.

How to know when they're ready: they ask, or they're leaning in. If they ask about price, they're engaged. They want to know. That's your signal. If they're leaning in, nodding along, asking questions, they're ready. If they're looking away, checking their phone, giving one-word answers, they're not ready. Keep building value.

The "what this does for YOU" framework shifts focus from product to person. Instead of "We offer quarterly treatments," say "You won't have to think about bugs again." Instead of "We have 24/7 monitoring," say "You can sleep knowing someone's watching your home." Make it about them, not about you.

Stacking benefits until price feels like a bargain is the goal. One benefit might not justify the cost. Three benefits might. Five benefits definitely will. Keep stacking until they're thinking "This is worth it" before you even mention price. When you finally do mention price, it should feel like a natural next step, not a shock.

If they ask price too early, don't panic. Say "Great question—let me show you what's included first so the price makes sense." Then continue building value. They asked because they're curious, not because they're ready to buy. Use their curiosity to build more desire.

The goal: they should be surprised the price is so LOW, not so high. When you've built enough value, price becomes a detail, not a dealbreaker. When you haven't built enough value, price becomes an objection, not an opportunity.

On your next 5 doors, don't mention price until they ask or until you've named at least 3 benefits. Notice how many more people actually want to know the price versus when you lead with it. The difference will show you the power of value-first selling.
