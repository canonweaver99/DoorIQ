# Keep Ammo in Your Pocket
**Estimated read: 2 minutes**

Don't dump every feature in the first 60 seconds. Information overload kills interest—they stop listening.

You've got 20 features. They care about maybe three. Figure out which three matter to them, and focus there. Save the rest for objections. When you list everything upfront, you sound like you're reading a brochure. When you reveal benefits strategically, you sound like you understand their situation. Guess which one closes more deals?

Hold back value points to use when overcoming objections. If you've already mentioned everything, you have nothing left when they push back. If you've held back your best differentiators, you can reveal them at the perfect moment. That moment is when they object. That's when they're listening hardest. That's when your ammo matters most.

The "one more thing" technique reveals benefits strategically. After they've heard your main pitch, after they've processed the initial value, hit them with "Oh, and one more thing..." Then reveal something powerful. A warranty. A guarantee. A bonus feature. Something that makes them think "Wait, this is even better than I thought."

If they're already sold, stop selling. Don't keep talking. Don't add more features. Don't risk talking them out of it. When they're ready to buy, close. When they're not ready, that's when you use your ammo. Save your best stuff for when you need it most.

Save your best differentiators for when they push back. Price objection? Reveal the warranty. Timing objection? Reveal the limited-time bonus. Comparison objection? Reveal the unique feature competitors don't have. Your ammo is your secret weapon—don't waste it on doors that are already open.

Example flow that works: Initial pitch covers 3 key benefits. First objection gets the warranty or guarantee revealed. Second objection gets price flexibility or bonus feature revealed. Close reminds them of the entire stack. Each objection becomes an opportunity to add more value, not defend what you've already said.

Think of your pitch like a deck of cards—play them one at a time. Don't show your whole hand upfront. Show enough to get them interested. Then reveal more as they engage. As they object. As they need more reasons to say yes. Strategic revelation beats information dumping every time.

When you keep ammo in your pocket, you always have something to overcome objections. When you dump everything upfront, you're defenseless when they push back. Save your best for when it matters most.
