# Painting the Picture
**Estimated read: 3 minutes**

Words create images—use them strategically. Make the invisible problem visible, then paint the solution in vivid detail.

Describing the problem vividly before offering the solution creates urgency. Don't just say "pests are annoying." Paint the picture: "You're having dinner with your family, and a roach crawls across the table. Your kids are grossed out, your wife's embarrassed, and you're frustrated because you thought you'd dealt with this." That's not annoying—that's a problem they can feel.

Walk them through the scenario using "Imagine this..." Make it real. Make it visceral. Make it something they can see happening in their own home. When they can visualize the problem, they can feel the need for the solution. When they can't visualize it, they can't feel the urgency.

Use their environment to make it concrete. Point to the flower bed: "See those ants by your foundation? They're using that crack to get into your walls right now." Point to the eaves: "That's where wasps build nests—right where your kids play." Point to the meter: "Every month that bill comes, that's money you'll never see again." Point to the router location: "When everyone's home streaming at once, that's when you notice the lag."

Slow hand movements to illustrate what you're describing. When you point, they look. When they look, they see. When they see, they understand. Don't just talk—show. Your hands become your visual aids. Use them to guide their attention to what matters.

Get them physically involved. Have them look where you're pointing. Walk with you around the property. Touch the problem area. When they're physically engaged, they're mentally engaged. When they're just listening, they can tune out. When they're looking and touching, they're invested.

Creating urgency through visualization works because it makes abstract problems concrete. "If we don't treat this now, by July you'll see..." makes them see the future problem. "Every month that bill comes, that's money you'll never see again" makes them feel the ongoing cost. "When everyone's home streaming at once, that's when you notice the lag" makes them experience the frustration.

Industry examples that paint pictures: Pest control can say "See those ants by your foundation? They're using that crack to get into your walls right now." Solar can say "Every month that bill comes, that's money you'll never see again." Internet can say "When everyone's home streaming at once, that's when you notice the lag." Each of these creates a visual, visceral understanding of the problem.

Make the invisible problem visible. Most problems are hidden until they're not. Show them what's happening behind the scenes. Show them what's coming if they don't act. Show them what they're missing by not having your solution. When they can see it, they can feel it. When they can feel it, they can act on it.
