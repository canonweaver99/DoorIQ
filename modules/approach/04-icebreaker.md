# The Icebreaker That Works
**Estimated read: 3 minutes**

Your opener has one job: get them to stop and listen. Most reps fail here because they lead with their company name instead of curiosity.

Every icebreaker must do three things: acknowledge their time, establish legitimacy, and create curiosity. Acknowledge their time shows respect. "I know you're busy" or "This will just take a second" tells them you value what they're doing. Establish legitimacy makes you credible. "I'm working with a few of your neighbors" or "I'm doing a quick survey in your area" tells them you're not random. Create curiosity makes them want to know more. "Quick question" or "I noticed something" makes them lean in instead of lean away.

Why questions beat statements every time. Questions require engagement. Statements invite dismissal. When you ask "Have you noticed more bugs this season?" they have to think about it. When you say "I'm here to tell you about our pest control service," they can tune you out. Questions create a moment of connection. Statements create a moment of resistance.

The "neighbor" framework gives you instant credibility. "I just finished up at the Johnson's place down the street" or "I'm working with a few neighbors on a group discount" makes you local, not random. It makes you legitimate, not suspicious. When you mention neighbors, you're not a stranger anymore—you're someone who belongs in their neighborhood.

Industry-specific icebreakers that work: Pest control can ask "Have you noticed more bugs this season?" Solar can ask "What's your average electric bill?" Internet can ask "Are you getting the speeds you're paying for?" Security can ask "Do you have a security system?" Roofing can ask "Did you get any damage from that last storm?" Each of these opens a conversation instead of starting a pitch.

Adapting to their energy when they open the door is crucial. If they look rushed, match their pace: "Quick question—30 seconds?" If they look relaxed, slow down: "Hey, got a minute? I'm working with some neighbors." If they look annoyed, acknowledge it: "I know this is unexpected, but quick question?" If they look curious, lean in: "I noticed something about your house—mind if I show you?"

The best icebreakers feel like conversations, not sales pitches. They make homeowners want to answer. They make homeowners want to know more. They make homeowners see you as helpful, not pushy.
