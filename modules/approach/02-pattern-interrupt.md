# The Pattern Interrupt
**Estimated read: 3 minutes**

They expect you to start selling immediately. That's exactly why you shouldn't.

Homeowners have a script running in their head the moment they see you: "Here comes another salesperson. They're going to tell me about their product. I'm going to say no. They're going to push. I'm going to get annoyed and shut the door." You need to interrupt that script in the first 30 seconds, or you're just playing your part in their predictable story.

Don't mention your product in the first 30 seconds. Don't mention your company. Don't mention what you're selling. Instead, acknowledge their skepticism upfront. Say something like "I know you weren't expecting me, and I'm not here to waste your time." Or "Quick question—are you the homeowner?" Simple, direct, non-threatening. You're not selling yet. You're just asking.

The "Quick question" framework works because questions require answers. When you ask a question, they have to engage. When you make a statement, they can ignore you. Questions create a moment of curiosity. Statements create a moment of resistance.

Your goal is to get them to see you as human, not a threat. Once they see you as human, they'll listen. Until then, you're just noise. The fastest way to become human is to acknowledge what they're probably thinking. "I know this is unexpected." "I know you're probably busy." "I know you get a lot of people knocking on your door." When you acknowledge their reality, you stop being a threat and start being a person.

This works across every industry. Pest control reps can start with "Quick question—have you noticed more bugs this season?" Solar reps can ask "What's your average electric bill?" Internet reps can say "Are you getting the speeds you're paying for?" Security reps can ask "Do you have a security system?" Roofing reps can mention "Did you get any damage from that last storm?"

Notice the pattern? You're not selling. You're asking. You're gathering information. You're positioning yourself as someone doing research or helping neighbors. That's not threatening—that's interesting. When you flip their script, you create space for a real conversation instead of a sales pitch they're already prepared to reject.
