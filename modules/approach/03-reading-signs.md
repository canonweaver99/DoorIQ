# Reading the Signs
**Estimated read: 3 minutes**

Before you knock, read the house. It's telling you everything you need to know.

Signs of life are your best friend. Cars in the driveway? Good sign—they're home. Multiple cars? Even better—more decision makers present. Lights on inside? They're definitely there. Toys scattered in the yard? They're home and probably busy with kids—perfect timing for a quick, respectful approach. A/C unit running? Someone's definitely inside. TV sounds or music? They're awake and active.

When to knock versus when to skip is simple: if there are signs of life, knock. If there aren't, skip it. You're wasting your time knocking on empty houses, and you're annoying people who aren't even there. Save your energy for doors that might actually open.

Time of day strategy matters. Early morning? They're probably rushing—kids to school, work to get to. Keep it brief. Late afternoon? They might be more receptive—workday winding down, less pressure. Evening? Hit or miss. Some people are done with their day and want to relax. Others are just getting started with dinner and family time. Read the situation and adjust your energy accordingly.

Reading the neighborhood tells you what to expect. Nice yards with fresh landscaping? These homeowners care about their property—they might be more receptive to maintenance or improvement services. Neglected yards? They might be struggling financially or just not prioritizing home care—adjust your approach. New construction? They just moved in—perfect timing for security, internet, or other essential services. Older homes? They might need updates or repairs.

Adjust your energy based on what you observe before knocking. See kids' toys? They're busy parents—be respectful of their time. See work trucks? They might be contractors or tradespeople—speak their language. See luxury cars? They have money—don't be afraid to present premium options. See "No Soliciting" signs? Skip it entirely—they've made their position clear.

The "re-knock" strategy works: make morning passes for early risers and evening passes for night owls. Some people are home in the morning but not afternoon. Others are home in the evening but not morning. If you see signs of life but no answer, try a different time. Don't give up after one attempt if the signs suggest they're there.
