# Positioning Yourself (Literally)
**Estimated read: 2 minutes**

## Why This Matters

Your body position before they even open the door determines whether they'll listen or slam it shut. Most reps don't think about positioning—they just stand there and hope for the best. Top reps know that positioning is psychology, and psychology wins sales.

## The Mistake Most Reps Make

They stand straight-on to the door, hands in pockets, looking desperate. Straight-on feels like a confrontation. It's aggressive. Standing there waiting makes you look like you have nowhere else to be. That screams "desperate" and "amateur." Homeowners can sense desperation from 10 feet away, and desperate reps get doors slammed.

## The Framework

Stand at a 45-degree angle to the door, never straight-on. The angle says "I'm here, but I'm not invading your space." It's subtle psychology, but it works. When you're angled, you look less threatening. You look like someone who's passing through, not someone who's about to launch into a sales pitch.

Lean slightly away from the door, like you're about to leave. This signals you're not desperate. Desperate reps lean in, hands on the doorframe, looking like they're trying to force their way in. Confident reps lean back. They look like they have somewhere else to be. That makes homeowners curious—why isn't this person desperate?

Look busy while you wait. Check your phone. Glance at your clipboard. Shift your weight. You want them to think you're doing something important, not waiting for them. When they see you looking busy, they think "This person has a purpose." When they see you just standing there, they think "This person is here to waste my time."

What NOT to do: Standing straight-on makes you look confrontational. Hands in pockets makes you look unprofessional. Slouching makes you look lazy. Leaning against the doorframe makes you look like you're trying to block them from closing the door. All of these scream "amateur" and "desperate."

Your body language should scream "I'm not desperate." Desperate reps get doors slammed. Confident reps get conversations. The difference is often just a few inches of positioning and the angle of your shoulders.

## Example Scripts

**The Setup:**
> **Rep:** (Standing at 45-degree angle, leaning back slightly, checking clipboard)
> *Knocks and steps back half a step*
> **Homeowner:** (Opens door wider, curious)
> **Rep:** "Quick question—are you the homeowner?"

**The Positioning:**
> **Rep:** (Maintains angle, doesn't lean in)
> **Homeowner:** "Yes, what's this about?"
> **Rep:** "I'm working with a few neighbors on something—got 30 seconds?"

Notice how the positioning creates space. The homeowner opens the door wider because you're not invading their space. They're curious because you look like you have somewhere else to be.

Practice your stance before you knock. Stand at the angle. Lean back slightly. Hold your materials naturally. Look busy. When you knock, step back half a step. Give them space. Let them come to you, even if it's just opening the door wider.
