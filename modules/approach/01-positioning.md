# Positioning Yourself (Literally)
**Estimated read: 2 minutes**

Your body position before they even open the door determines whether they'll listen or slam it shut.

Stand at a 45-degree angle to the door, never straight-on. Straight-on feels like a confrontation. It's aggressive. The angle says "I'm here, but I'm not invading your space." It's subtle psychology, but it works. When you're angled, you look less threatening. You look like someone who's passing through, not someone who's about to launch into a sales pitch.

Lean slightly away from the door, like you're about to leave. This signals you're not desperate. Desperate reps lean in, hands on the doorframe, looking like they're trying to force their way in. Confident reps lean back. They look like they have somewhere else to be. That makes homeowners curious—why isn't this person desperate?

Look busy while you wait. Check your phone. Glance at your clipboard. Shift your weight. You want them to think you're doing something important, not waiting for them. When they see you looking busy, they think "This person has a purpose." When they see you just standing there, they think "This person is here to waste my time."

What NOT to do: Standing straight-on makes you look confrontational. Hands in pockets makes you look unprofessional. Slouching makes you look lazy. Leaning against the doorframe makes you look like you're trying to block them from closing the door. All of these scream "amateur" and "desperate."

Your body language should scream "I'm not desperate." Desperate reps get doors slammed. Confident reps get conversations. The difference is often just a few inches of positioning and the angle of your shoulders.

Practice your stance before you knock. Stand at the angle. Lean back slightly. Hold your materials naturally. Look busy. When you knock, step back half a step. Give them space. Let them come to you, even if it's just opening the door wider.
