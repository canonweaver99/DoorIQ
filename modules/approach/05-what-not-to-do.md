# What Not to Do
**Estimated read: 3 minutes**

Sometimes the best advice is knowing what to avoid. These mistakes kill conversations before they start.

Don't lead with "Hi, I'm from [Company]." That's code for "I'm here to sell you something." The moment you say your company name, their defenses go up. They've already decided to say no. Instead, lead with a question or an observation. Make them curious first. Tell them who you are later, after they're already engaged.

Don't mention price in the first minute. Price is the last thing they should think about. If you're talking price before they understand value, you've already lost. Build desire first. Make them want what you're offering. Then price becomes a detail, not a dealbreaker. When you lead with price, you're competing on cost. When you lead with value, you're competing on results.

Don't list features before building rapport. Features are boring when they don't know you. Benefits are compelling when they trust you. Build trust first. Show them you understand their situation. Then your features become relevant. Until then, you're just listing things they don't care about.

Don't apologize for being there. "Sorry to bother you" or "I know you're busy" sounds weak. Confidence, not apology. You're there to help them. You're there to solve a problem. You're not bothering them—you're serving them. When you apologize, you're telling them they should feel annoyed. When you're confident, you're telling them they should feel curious.

Don't dress like a walking billboard. If you're wearing a company polo covered in logos and carrying a clipboard with brochures, you look like every other rep they've ignored. Dress like a professional, not a salesman. Look like someone they'd want to talk to, not someone they'd want to avoid. Your appearance should say "I'm here to help," not "I'm here to sell."

Don't predetermine outcomes based on house appearance. Nice house doesn't mean they'll buy. Modest house doesn't mean they won't. Every door is a new opportunity. Don't skip houses because they look "too nice" or "too poor." You don't know their situation. You don't know their needs. Knock every door with signs of life and let them decide.

The "cancer rep" mentality kills momentum. That's the rep who complains about everything: "This neighborhood is terrible." "Nobody's buying today." "These people are cheap." Negativity is contagious. When you're negative, you attract negative results. When you're positive, you attract positive results. Your mindset determines your outcomes.
