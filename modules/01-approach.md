# The Approach: Your First 5 Seconds Decide Everything
**Estimated read: 3 minutes**

You've got five seconds to change their mind about you. Not about your product—about you. Most homeowners have already decided you're a pushy salesman before you even open your mouth. Your job in those first five seconds is to prove them wrong.

## Positioning Yourself (Literally)

Stand at a 45-degree angle to the door, not straight-on. Straight-on feels confrontational. The angle says "I'm here, but I'm not invading your space." Lean slightly away from the door, like you're about to leave. Look busy—check your phone, glance at your clipboard, shift your weight. You want them to think you're doing something important, not waiting for them.

Your body language should scream "I'm not desperate." Desperate reps get doors slammed. Confident reps get conversations.

## The Pattern Interrupt

They expect you to start selling immediately. Flip the script. Don't mention your product in the first 30 seconds. Instead, acknowledge what they're probably thinking: "Hey, I know you weren't expecting me, and I'm not here to waste your time." Or better: "Quick question—are you the homeowner?" Simple, direct, non-threatening.

The goal is to get them to see you as human, not a threat. Once they see you as human, they'll listen. Until then, you're just noise.

## Reading the Signs

Before you knock, look for signs of life. Cars in the driveway? Good sign. Lights on? Even better. Toys in the yard? They're home and probably busy—perfect timing for a quick, respectful approach. No signs of life? Skip it. You're wasting your time and annoying someone who isn't even there.

Timing matters. Early morning? They're probably rushing. Late afternoon? They might be more receptive. Evening? Hit or miss—some people are done with their day, others are just getting started. Read the situation and adjust.

## The Icebreaker That Works

Your opener should do three things: acknowledge their time, establish legitimacy, and create curiosity. Here's what works across industries:

**Pest Control:** "Hey, quick question—have you noticed more bugs than usual this season? I'm working with a few of your neighbors on a neighborhood-wide treatment program."

**Solar:** "I'm doing a quick survey in your area about energy costs. Mind if I ask—what's your average electric bill?"

**Internet:** "I'm checking internet speeds in your neighborhood. Are you getting the speeds you're paying for?"

**Home Security:** "Quick question—do you have a security system? I'm working with a few neighbors on a group discount."

Notice the pattern? You're not selling. You're asking. You're gathering information. You're positioning yourself as someone doing research or helping neighbors. That's not threatening—that's interesting.

## What Not to Do

Don't start with "Hi, I'm from [Company]." That's code for "I'm here to sell you something." Don't mention price in the first minute. Don't list features. Don't apologize for being there. Confidence, not apology.

Don't look like a salesman. If you're wearing a company polo and carrying a clipboard with brochures, you look like every other rep they've ignored. Dress like a professional, not a walking billboard.

## The Transition

Once you've broken the pattern and they're listening, transition naturally. "Actually, since I'm here, let me show you something quick." Or "You know what, I've got something that might help with that." The key word is "quick." Nobody has time for a 30-minute pitch. But everyone has time for "quick."
