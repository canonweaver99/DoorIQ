# Overcoming Objections: The R.A.C. Framework
**Estimated read: 3 minutes**

Objections aren't "no." They're "not yet." Most reps hear an objection and panic. Top reps hear an objection and think: "Perfect, now I know what they're actually thinking. Let me address this."

## Smokescreens vs Real Objections

First time they say "I need to think about it"? That's a smokescreen. They're buying time, not saying no. Second time they say it? Now it's real. Address it.

Smokescreens are easy to spot: "I need to talk to my spouse," "Let me check my budget," "I'll call you back." Real objections are specific: "It's too expensive," "I already have a service," "I don't trust door-to-door salespeople."

Treat smokescreens like buying signals. They're interested, they're just not ready to commit. Treat real objections like opportunities. They're telling you exactly what's blocking the sale. Fix that, and you've got a deal.

## The R.A.C. Framework

**Resolve, Ace, Close.** Three steps, every objection.

### Resolve: Acknowledge Without Validating

When they say "It's too expensive," don't say "Oh, you think it's expensive?" That repeats their objection and makes it stronger. Instead, say "Of course price matters." You're acknowledging their concern without agreeing with it.

**Bad:** "Oh, you're not seeing bugs? That's great!" (You just validated their reason to say no.)
**Good:** "Of course you want to make sure you're getting value." (You acknowledged their concern without validating their excuse.)

The word "of course" is powerful. It says "I understand, I'm not surprised, and I've got this handled."

### Ace: Tip the Scale

Now give them something that tips the scale in your favor. A feature they didn't know about. A specific benefit that addresses their concern. A price adjustment or payment plan.

**Price objection:** "Of course price matters. That's why we offer a payment plan that's less than what most people spend on coffee each month."

**Already have service:** "Of course you want to stick with what works. That's why we offer a free comparison—no commitment, just see if we can save you money or give you better service."

**Need to think:** "Of course you want to make the right decision. That's why I'm here—to answer any questions so you can decide with confidence."

You're not arguing. You're adding information that changes their perspective.

### Close: Ask Again

After you've resolved and aced, close. Don't wait for them to bring it up. "So, should we get you set up?" or "Ready to get started?" or "Want me to check availability?"

Most reps stop after resolving. Top reps always close after acing.

## Mirroring Energy

Match their energy before redirecting. If they're calm, stay calm. If they're excited, match that excitement. If they're skeptical, acknowledge the skepticism.

**They're skeptical:** "I get it—you've probably heard this before. Let me show you something different."

**They're rushed:** "I know you're busy. Let me make this quick—30 seconds, that's it."

**They're friendly:** "I appreciate that! Let me show you something I think you'll really like."

Mirror first, redirect second. If you redirect without mirroring, you sound like you're not listening.

## When to Walk Away

Some objections are real dealbreakers. "I'm moving next month" is probably real. "I'm filing for bankruptcy" is definitely real. "My spouse said absolutely not" might be real.

But most objections are excuses. "I need to think about it" is an excuse. "I'll call you back" is an excuse. "Let me check my budget" is an excuse.

If it's a real dealbreaker, respect it. "I understand. When would be a better time to follow up?" Get their contact info, set a reminder, move on.

If it's an excuse, push through. Use R.A.C. and close again.

## Never Repeat Their Objection

This is critical: Don't repeat their objection back to them. If they say "It's too expensive," don't say "So you think it's too expensive?" That just reinforces their objection.

Instead, reframe it. "So price is a concern?" or "So you want to make sure you're getting value?" You're addressing the same concern, but you're framing it in a way that's easier to overcome.

## Examples Across Industries

**Pest Control:** "I already have a service."
**Resolve:** "Of course you want to stick with what works."
**Ace:** "That's why I'm offering a free comparison—no commitment, just see if we can do better."
**Close:** "Want me to show you what we offer?"

**Solar:** "I can't afford it."
**Resolve:** "Of course affordability matters."
**Ace:** "That's why we offer zero down and payments that are less than your current electric bill."
**Close:** "Want me to run the numbers for you?"

**Internet:** "I'm happy with what I have."
**Resolve:** "Of course you want to stick with what works."
**Ace:** "That's why I'm just asking—are you getting the speeds you're paying for? If you are, great. If not, I can help."
**Close:** "Want me to check your speeds real quick?"

Next time you hear an objection, don't repeat it. Instead, acknowledge it with "Of course," then add one piece of information that addresses their concern, then ask for the close. Practice this three-step process on your next five objections.
