# Body Language — What You're Saying Without Words
**Estimated read: 3 minutes**

55% of communication is body language. They're reading you before you speak. What you're saying without words matters more than what you're saying with words.

Positive signals: open posture, relaxed shoulders, natural hand movements, grounded stance. These signal confidence, approachability, trustworthiness. Negative signals: shuffling feet, hands in pockets, crossed arms, looking down, fidgeting. These signal nervousness, defensiveness, untrustworthiness. Your body speaks louder than your mouth.

Slow, deliberate movements equal confidence and control. Fast, jerky movements equal nervousness and desperation. When you move slowly, you look like you have time. When you have time, you look like you're not desperate. When you're not desperate, they trust you. Control your movements. Control your image.

Use your hands to illustrate. "We spray three feet up" — show it with your hand. "The treatment covers this area" — point to it. When you use your hands, you're engaging multiple senses. They see what you're saying. That makes it real. That makes it memorable. Don't just talk—show.

Keep your body open. Don't create barriers between you and the customer. Crossed arms create barriers. Hands in pockets create barriers. Closed posture creates barriers. Open posture invites conversation. Open arms invite trust. Open body language invites sales.

Grounded stance: feet shoulder-width apart, weight evenly distributed. No swaying. No shifting. No fidgeting. When you're grounded, you look stable. When you look stable, you look trustworthy. When you look trustworthy, they listen. Stand like you belong there.

Head nods work. Nod slightly when making a point. They'll subconsciously nod back and agree. It's subtle psychology, but it works. When you nod, they nod. When they nod, they agree. When they agree, they buy. Use nods strategically. Don't overdo it. Just enough to create agreement.

Smile when the door opens. Smiling is contagious—it disarms them immediately. A smile says "I'm friendly." A smile says "I'm not a threat." A smile says "This will be pleasant." Start with a smile. End with a smile. Smile throughout. It changes everything.

Someone is always watching: neighbors, cameras, people driving by. Your body language is your reputation. Stand tall. Move confidently. Look professional. You're not just selling to the person at the door. You're building your reputation with everyone who sees you.
