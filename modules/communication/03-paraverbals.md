# Paraverbals — It's Not What You Say, It's How You Say It
**Estimated read: 3 minutes**

Paraverbal equals tone, pitch, pacing, volume—everything except the actual words. The same sentence can mean completely different things based on delivery.

Example: "I didn't say YOU were stupid" versus "I didn't say you were STUPID." Same words. Different emphasis. Different meaning. That's the power of paraverbals. Your words are the script. Your paraverbals are the performance.

Volume matters. Too loud equals aggressive. Too quiet equals nervous. Match the situation. Match their volume, then speak slightly quieter when making important points. People lean in to hear you. Leaning in equals engagement. Use volume strategically.

Pacing matters. Too fast equals anxious, untrustworthy. Too slow equals boring, condescending. Conversational is the goal. Match their pace, then slow down slightly for key points. When you slow down, they pay attention. When you speed up, they feel rushed. Find the rhythm.

Down-toning is crucial. End statements with your voice going DOWN, not up. Up-tone equals question, uncertainty: "We treat the whole yard?" Down-tone equals statement, confidence: "We treat the whole yard." See the difference? One sounds like you're asking permission. One sounds like you're stating fact. Down-tone everything.

Pause for emphasis. Silence before a key point makes it land harder. When you pause, they wait. When they wait, they listen. When they listen, they remember. Use pauses strategically. After benefits. Before closes. During transitions. Silence is powerful. Use it.

When nervous, most reps speed up without realizing it. Slow down intentionally. Nervous energy makes you rush. Rushing makes you sound desperate. Desperation kills sales. Breathe. Pause. Slow down. Confidence comes from control. Control your pace.

Record yourself practicing your pitch. Listen for volume, pace, and tone. Adjust. You can't fix what you can't hear. Record yourself. Listen critically. What sounds confident? What sounds desperate? What sounds natural? Adjust until it sounds right.

Paraverbals are invisible, but they're everything. Your words can be perfect, but if your paraverbals are wrong, you'll lose. Your words can be simple, but if your paraverbals are right, you'll win. Master the delivery, not just the script.
