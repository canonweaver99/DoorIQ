# Eye Contact — Look, Don't Stare
**Estimated read: 2 minutes**

Good eye contact equals confidence, sincerity, trust. Too much eye contact equals creepy, aggressive, uncomfortable. Too little equals nervous, shady, untrustworthy.

The sweet spot: 3-4 seconds of eye contact, then break naturally. Don't stare. Don't avoid. Just connect, then look away with purpose. That purpose matters. Break eye contact with intention—look where you want them to look.

Use your eyes to control the conversation. Glance at the yard, the eaves, the foundation. They'll follow your gaze. Now you're guiding the interaction. When you look somewhere, they look there too. Use that to direct their attention to what matters. Point with your eyes, not just your hands.

When making a key point, lock eyes briefly—it adds weight. When you lock eyes during an important statement, it signals "This matters." They'll pay attention. They'll remember. Use this strategically. Don't waste it on small talk. Save it for value statements and closes.

When listening, maintain softer eye contact—show you're engaged. You don't need to stare while they're talking. Softer eye contact shows you're listening without being intense. Look at them, but don't lock eyes. That's for when you're speaking, not when they're speaking.

Cultural note: some people are uncomfortable with direct eye contact. Read the situation. If they're avoiding your eyes, don't force it. Adjust your approach. Match their comfort level. You can build rapport without constant eye contact. You just need to read the person.

If they won't look at you, they're not engaged. Ask a question to pull them back. "Does that make sense?" or "What do you think?" Questions require answers. Answers require engagement. Engagement requires eye contact. Use questions to re-engage when they drift.

Eye contact is a tool, not a rule. Use it strategically. Use it naturally. Use it to build trust and guide attention. But don't overthink it. Natural eye contact feels right. Forced eye contact feels wrong. Find the balance.
