# Mirroring — Get Into Their World
**Estimated read: 3 minutes**

When you knock, they're in their world—watching TV, cooking, working, napping. Your knock disrupts that world. Your job is to pull them into yours.

But first, you have to meet them where they are. Mirroring means reflecting their energy, mood, and body language. If they're low energy and quiet, don't come in like a game show host. If they're high energy and chatty, match that enthusiasm. You can't pull them into your world until you've entered theirs.

Physical mirroring works because it creates subconscious rapport. They lean on the doorframe, you lean on the wall. They cross their arms, you relax yours—but don't mirror negativity. If they're defensive, neutralize it with open body language. Mirror positive signals. Neutralize negative ones.

Vocal mirroring matches their volume, pace, and tone. Quiet speaker? Lower your voice. Fast talker? Speed up slightly. Serious tone? Match it. Casual tone? Match that too. When you match their vocal patterns, they feel like you "get" them. That feeling creates trust.

Mirroring builds subconscious rapport—they feel like you "get" them without knowing why. It's not manipulation. It's connection. When you mirror someone, you're showing them you understand their state. That understanding creates comfort. That comfort creates conversation.

Once you've matched their energy, you can slowly lead them to a more engaged state. Don't jump from their energy level to yours immediately. Match first. Build rapport. Then gradually elevate. If they're at a 3, match the 3. Then slowly move to 4, then 5. They'll follow because they trust you.

The goal: get them out of their world and into a conversation with you. Their world is comfortable. Your conversation is new. Mirroring bridges that gap. It makes the transition feel natural, not forced. It makes them want to engage, not retreat.

When mirroring works, they don't notice you're doing it. They just feel comfortable. They just feel understood. They just feel like you're on the same wavelength. That's when real conversations happen. That's when sales close.

On every door, consciously identify their energy level (1-10) and match it before trying to lead them anywhere. Notice how much easier conversations become when you start where they are instead of where you want them to be.
