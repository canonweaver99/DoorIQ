# Reading Their Body Language
**Estimated read: 3 minutes**

You're not just broadcasting—you're receiving. Watch them closely. Their body language tells you everything you need to know.

Positive signs mean keep going: leaning in, uncrossed arms, nodding along, asking questions, stepping outside the doorframe. These signals say "I'm engaged. I'm interested. Keep talking." When you see these, you're winning. Speed up toward the close. Build more value. They're ready.

Negative signs mean adjust immediately: arms crossed, leaning away, looking at their phone, short clipped answers, hand on the door ready to close it. These signals say "I'm not interested. I'm defensive. I want this to end." When you see these, don't plow ahead. Pause and re-engage.

If you see negative signals, don't plow ahead—pause and re-engage. Ask a question: "Does that make sense?" or "What's your biggest concern?" Questions pull them back. Questions require answers. Answers require engagement. When they're disengaged, questions re-engage them.

Sometimes they're just distracted, not disinterested. A question pulls them back. They might be thinking about dinner, work, kids. A question brings them back to you. "What do you think about that?" or "Does that sound like something that would help?" These questions re-engage without being pushy.

The door close signal: if their hand goes to the door, you're losing them. Pivot fast. Don't keep pitching. Don't ignore it. Address it immediately. "I can see you're busy. Let me just show you one quick thing." Or "I know I'm taking your time. One more minute?" When their hand goes to the door, you're on borrowed time. Use it wisely.

Positive signals equal speed up toward close. Negative signals equal slow down, rebuild rapport. Read the signals. Respond accordingly. Don't ignore what their body is telling you. Their body doesn't lie. Their mouth might. Trust the body language.

Trust what their body is telling you more than what their mouth is saying. People say "I'm interested" while crossing their arms. People say "Tell me more" while looking at their phone. The body tells the truth. The mouth tells what they think you want to hear. Read the body. Trust the body.

Reading body language is a skill. Practice it. Every door is practice. Watch for signals. Respond to signals. Adjust based on signals. The better you read them, the better you sell to them. It's that simple.
