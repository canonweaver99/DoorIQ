# Energy Management — Yours and Theirs
**Estimated read: 3 minutes**

Your energy is contagious—for better or worse. If you're tired, defeated, or frustrated, they'll feel it before you say a word. If you're confident, upbeat, and genuine, they'll respond to that too.

Reset between doors: don't carry a bad interaction to the next one. That last door doesn't matter. This door matters. Every door is a new opportunity. The last door doesn't exist. Only this door exists. Reset mentally. Reset physically. Reset emotionally.

Physical reset: take a breath, shake it off, roll your shoulders, walk with purpose. Your body affects your mind. When you reset your body, you reset your mind. When you reset your mind, you reset your energy. Don't carry tension. Don't carry frustration. Don't carry defeat. Leave it at the last door.

Mental reset: every door is a new opportunity. The last door doesn't matter. This door matters. The last rejection doesn't matter. This conversation matters. The last "no" doesn't matter. This "yes" matters. Reset your mindset. Reset your expectations. Reset your energy.

Match their energy first, then elevate it slightly. Don't be Barney the Dinosaur to someone who's clearly exhausted. Don't be low-energy with someone who's excited and chatty. Match where they are, then lead them where you want them to be. That's energy management.

Your energy should pull them toward a buying state, not push them away. High energy can overwhelm. Low energy can bore. Controlled energy engages. Find the balance. High enough to be engaging. Calm enough to be trustworthy. That's controlled energy. That's what closes deals.

The best reps have "controlled energy"—high enough to be engaging, calm enough to be trustworthy. You're not a cheerleader. You're not a robot. You're a professional. Professional energy is confident, not desperate. Professional energy is engaging, not overwhelming. Professional energy closes deals.

End of day energy: the last hour is where reps fade. Push through—that's where deals hide. When you're tired, that's when discipline matters. When you're fading, that's when you dig deep. The last hour separates good reps from great reps. Push through. Close strong.

Morning meetings, music, caffeine, movement—find what keeps your energy up and use it. Energy management is personal. What works for you might not work for others. Find your tools. Use them consistently. Your energy is your asset. Manage it like one.
