# The Close: Why Customers Expect You to Ask
**Estimated read: 2 minutes**

Customers expect you to close. Seriously. They're standing at the door, listening to your pitch, and thinking: "When is this person going to ask me to buy?" If you don't close, they're confused. Did you forget? Are you not confident in your product? Do you not want the sale?

Closing isn't pushy. Closing is professional. Closing is expected.

## Why Reps Fear Closing

Most reps are afraid to close because they're afraid of rejection. But here's the thing: If you don't ask, you'll never know. And if you don't ask, you're wasting everyone's time—theirs and yours.

The customer has already invested time listening to you. They've already considered your product. They're waiting for you to make it easy for them to say yes. That's your job. Make it easy.

## Soft Closes vs Hard Closes

**Soft close:** Getting agreement that they want what you're offering. "Does this sound like something that would help you?" "Would you be interested in getting started?" "Should I check availability?"

**Hard close:** Collecting the information needed to complete the sale. Name, phone number, credit card, signature. The actual commitment.

You need both. Soft closes build momentum. Hard closes seal the deal.

## The Soft-to-Hard Close Sequence

Start soft, end hard. Don't jump straight to "Can I get your credit card?" That's jarring. Instead, build up to it.

**Soft close 1:** "Does this sound like something that would help you?" (Get agreement.)
**Soft close 2:** "Want me to check if we have availability in your area?" (Create urgency.)
**Hard close:** "Great! Let me get your information and we can get you set up today." (Collect the info.)

Each close builds on the last. If they say yes to the soft close, they're more likely to say yes to the hard close.

## Types of Soft Closes

**Urgency Close:** "We're only doing this neighborhood this week. After that, we move to the next area." Creates FOMO without being pushy.

**Bandwagon Close:** "I've already signed up three of your neighbors this week. They're all excited about it." Social proof is powerful.

**Option Close:** "We've got two options—the basic plan or the premium. Which one sounds better for you?" Give them choices, not ultimatums.

**Responsibility Close:** "This is really about protecting your family. That's worth it, right?" Appeal to their values.

**Sincerity Close:** "Look, I'm not here to pressure you. If this isn't right for you, that's totally fine. But if it is, let's get you set up." Honesty disarms skepticism.

Use different closes for different situations. Urgency works when they're on the fence. Bandwagon works when they're skeptical. Option works when they're interested but indecisive.

## The Hard Close

The hard close is simple: Collect the information you need to complete the sale. Name, phone number, address confirmation, payment method.

Don't ask permission to collect information. Just start collecting it. "Great! Let me get your name and phone number." Not "Can I get your name and phone number?" The first is assumptive. The second gives them a chance to say no.

Assumptive language throughout the conversation makes the hard close easier. "When we get you set up..." not "If we get you set up..." "Your first service will be..." not "If you decide to sign up..."

## The 3-Close Rule

Ask three times before leaving any door. Not three hard closes—that's pushy. Three soft closes, building to a hard close.

**Close 1:** "Does this sound like something that would help?"
**If yes:** Move to close 2.
**If no:** Address the objection, then try close 1 again.

**Close 2:** "Want me to check availability?"
**If yes:** Move to hard close.
**If no:** Address the concern, then try close 2 again.

**Close 3 (Hard):** "Let me get your information and we can get you set up."
**If yes:** You've got a sale.
**If no:** Address the final objection, then try one more time.

Three times. Not two. Not four. Three. After three, if they're still not interested, respect that and move on. But most reps give up after one. Don't be most reps.

## Assumptive Language Throughout

From the moment you start talking, use assumptive language. "When we get you set up..." "Your first service will be..." "You'll love how easy this is..."

Not "If you decide to sign up..." or "Should you choose our service..." Those phrases give them an out. Assumptive language creates momentum toward the close.

## Examples Across Industries

**Pest Control:** "When we get you on our quarterly program, you won't have to think about bugs again. Want me to check what dates work for your first treatment?"

**Solar:** "Once we get your system installed, your electric bill drops to basically nothing. Should I check if we have availability this month?"

**Internet:** "When we get you switched over, you'll notice the speed difference immediately. Want me to see what's available at your address?"

**Home Security:** "Once we get your system installed, you'll have 24/7 protection. Should I check what package works best for your home?"

Each example uses assumptive language ("when," "once") and ends with a soft close that leads to a hard close.

**Try This Today**

On your next five doors, use assumptive language from the start. Say "when" instead of "if," "your" instead of "the," and "we'll" instead of "you could." Then, before you leave any door, ask for the close three times. Watch how many more sales you get.
