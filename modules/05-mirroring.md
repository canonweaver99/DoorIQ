# Mirroring: Building Instant Rapport
**Estimated read: 3 minutes**

Mirroring is one of the most powerful communication techniques in sales. When done subtly, it creates an unconscious sense of familiarity and trust. People like people who are like them—it's that simple.

## What is Mirroring?

Mirroring means subtly matching the other person's body language, speech patterns, energy level, and even breathing. Not copying—matching. The goal is to create rapport without them realizing you're doing it.

## Body Language Mirroring

If they're leaning back, lean back slightly. If they're crossing their arms, wait a moment, then cross yours. If they're standing, stand. If they're sitting, sit. Match their posture, but give it a few seconds delay so it doesn't look obvious.

**Key Rule:** Mirror, don't mimic. If you copy them instantly, you look like a robot. If you match them after a pause, you look like you're naturally on the same wavelength.

## Speech Pattern Mirroring

Match their pace. Fast talker? Speed up slightly. Slow, deliberate speaker? Slow down. Match their volume. Quiet speaker? Lower your voice. Loud speaker? Raise yours slightly.

Match their tone. Serious? Be serious. Casual? Be casual. If they're using technical terms, use technical terms. If they're using simple language, keep it simple.

## Energy Level Matching

High energy homeowner bouncing around? Match that energy. Calm, measured homeowner? Match that calm. You want to be at their level, not above or below.

## When NOT to Mirror

Don't mirror negative body language. If they're defensive (crossed arms, closed off), don't match that. Instead, open up—uncross your arms, lean in slightly, show you're engaged. You want to lead them to a more open position, not match their closed one.

Don't mirror if they're clearly upset or agitated. Match their energy level, but keep your body language open and non-threatening.

## The Breathing Trick

Match their breathing rate. If they're breathing slowly, breathe slowly. If they're breathing quickly, breathe quickly. This creates a deep, unconscious connection. They'll feel more comfortable around you without knowing why.

## Practice Exercise

Next time you're in a conversation, try this: Match their posture for 30 seconds, then shift slightly. See if they follow you. If they do, you've built rapport. If they don't, keep mirroring and try again in a minute.
