# Paraverbals: The Hidden Language of Sales
**Estimated read: 3 minutes**

Paraverbals are how you say things—your pace, pitch, volume, and pauses. They're not what you say, but how you say it. And they matter more than you think.

## What Are Paraverbals?

Paraverbals include:
- **Pace:** How fast or slow you speak
- **Pitch:** How high or low your voice is
- **Volume:** How loud or quiet you are
- **Pauses:** Strategic silence
- **Emphasis:** Which words you stress

## Pace: The Speed of Trust

Fast pace = urgency, energy, but can feel rushed or desperate. Slow pace = thoughtfulness, confidence, but can feel boring or unsure.

**The Sweet Spot:** Match their pace, then slow down slightly when making key points. Slow down when talking about benefits. Speed up slightly when talking about urgency or scarcity.

## Pitch: The Sound of Confidence

High pitch = excitement, but can sound desperate or unsure. Low pitch = authority, confidence, but can sound monotone or boring.

**The Sweet Spot:** Lower your pitch slightly when making important points. Higher pitch for enthusiasm, lower pitch for seriousness.

## Volume: The Power of Presence

Loud = confident, but can be intimidating. Quiet = intimate, but can be hard to hear.

**The Sweet Spot:** Match their volume, then speak slightly quieter when making important points. People lean in to hear you. Leaning in = engagement.

## Pauses: The Power of Silence

A pause after a key point gives it weight. A pause before asking for the sale creates anticipation. A pause after they object gives you time to think and shows you're considering their concern.

**Strategic Pauses:**
- After stating a benefit
- Before asking for the sale
- After they raise an objection
- When transitioning between topics

## Emphasis: What You Stress Matters

Emphasize benefits, not features. Emphasize outcomes, not processes. Emphasize "you" and "your," not "I" and "we."

**Example:**
- Weak: "We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee."
- Strong: "You get a 30-day money-back guarantee."

## Matching Their Paraverbals

Match their pace, pitch, and volume, then gradually lead them to a more engaged state. If they're speaking slowly and quietly, match that, then gradually increase your energy to bring them up.

## Common Mistakes

**Rushing:** Don't rush. Slow down. Your pace should be deliberate.

**Monotone:** Vary your pitch. Keep it interesting.

**Too loud:** Lower your volume. Make them lean in.

**No pauses:** Use pauses. Silence is powerful.

**Wrong emphasis:** Emphasize benefits, not features.

## Practice Exercise

Record yourself delivering your pitch. Listen back and analyze:
- Is your pace too fast or too slow?
- Is your pitch varied or monotone?
- Are you using pauses effectively?
- Are you emphasizing the right words?
