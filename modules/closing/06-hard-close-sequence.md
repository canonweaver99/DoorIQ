# The Hard Close Sequence
**Estimated read: 3 minutes**

Once they've responded positively to a soft close—go immediately into the hard close. Don't pause, don't celebrate, don't ask "So you want to do it?" Just start collecting info.

The sequence flows naturally, not robotically. You're filling out information, not interrogating them. Keep it conversational. Keep it moving. Momentum is everything. When they say yes to a soft close, they're saying yes to moving forward. Capture that momentum immediately.

The sequence: "Perfect. What's the best name for the account?" Start with name. It's easy. It's non-threatening. It gets them talking. Then: "And what's a good phone number for you?" Continue the flow. Don't pause between questions. Keep moving. "Email?" Short and direct. They know what you need. "This address here, right?" Confirm the address. Make sure you have it right. "Anything specific I should note for the tech?" This makes them feel involved. It makes the sale feel real. "Are you using a credit or debit card today?" Payment question last. By then, everything else is done and backing out feels harder.

Keep it conversational—you're filling out info, not interrogating them. Don't sound like you're reading from a script. Don't sound like you're checking boxes. Sound like you're helping them get set up. That's the difference between closing and collecting.

If they hesitate at any point, address it calmly and continue. Don't panic. Don't back off. Address the concern. Answer the question. Then continue the sequence. "I understand you're worried about that. Here's how we handle it..." Then back to collecting info. Don't let hesitation derail the momentum.

Payment question last—by then, everything else is done and backing out feels harder. When you've collected name, phone, email, address, and notes, they're invested. They've given you information. They've committed mentally. The payment question feels like the final step, not the first commitment.

After payment: confirm next steps, thank them, move on confidently. "You're all set. My tech will be out [date]. You're going to love it." Don't linger. Don't keep selling. Don't second-guess. Confirm. Thank. Move on. Confidence in the close shows confidence in the sale.

The handoff is crucial: "You're all set. My tech will be out [date]. You're going to love it." This confirms everything. It sets expectations. It ends on a positive note. Then move on. Don't hang around. Don't keep talking. Close confidently. Leave confidently.

Speed and confidence matter. The faster you move through the sequence, the less time they have to second-guess. The more confident you sound, the more confident they feel. Master the sequence. Practice it until it flows. Then execute it with speed and confidence.
