# The 3-Close Rule
**Estimated read: 3 minutes**

The rule: Attempt to close at least 3 times before walking away from any door. Most sales happen after the second or third ask—not the first.

Why 3? Because most "no's" aren't real no's. They're soft no's. They're testing you. They're hesitating. They need reassurance. They need a new angle. The first close is where they test you. They say no to see if you'll fold. Most reps fold. Don't be most reps.

The first close: They're testing you. They say no to see if you'll fold. If you fold, you've confirmed their suspicion that you're not confident. If you persist, you've proven you believe in what you're selling. The first no is often just a test. Pass the test.

The second close: They're considering. They need reassurance or a new angle. Address their concern. Show them a different benefit. Give them a new reason to say yes. Then close again. The second close is where hesitation turns into interest. Don't skip it.

The third close: They're deciding. This is where deals happen. By the third close, they've heard everything. They've processed the value. They've considered the objections. Now they're deciding. This is your moment. Make it count.

Walking away after one "no" is leaving money on the table. Most reps do this. They hear one no and they're done. But one no isn't a rejection—it's a hesitation. Address it. Overcome it. Close again. That's how sales happen.

Each close should come from a different angle or address a new concern. Don't just ask the same question three times. That's annoying. First close: test interest. Second close: address concern, then test again. Third close: final push with new angle. Each close builds on the last.

The 3-close rule isn't about being annoying—it's about being persistent with purpose. You're not harassing them. You're helping them decide. You're giving them multiple opportunities to say yes. That's service, not pressure.

Know when to walk: If they're hostile, rude, or clearly not a buyer—move on. The 3-close rule isn't about forcing sales. It's about not giving up too early. But if they're genuinely not interested after three closes, respect that and move on.

Most "no's" are soft no's. They're not rejecting you—they're hesitating. Help them through the hesitation. That's what the 3-close rule does. It gives you three chances to help them decide. Use all three.
