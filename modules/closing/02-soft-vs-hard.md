# Soft Closes vs Hard Closes
**Estimated read: 3 minutes**

Soft closes open the door. Hard closes walk through it. You need both, and you need them in the right order.

A soft close is a question or statement that moves them toward commitment without directly asking for the sale. "Does this sound like something that would help you?" "Would you be interested in getting started?" "Should I check availability?" These test the water. Their response tells you if they're ready.

A hard close is directly collecting agreement information. Name, phone, email, payment. The actual commitment. "What's the best email for you?" "Are you using a credit or debit card?" These seal the deal. But you never jump straight to a hard close—you earn it with soft closes first.

Soft closes test the water. Their response tells you if they're ready. If they respond positively to a soft close, transition immediately to hard close. Don't pause. Don't celebrate. Don't ask "So you want to do it?" Just start collecting information. Momentum is everything. When they say yes to a soft close, they're saying yes to moving forward. Capture that momentum immediately.

If they hesitate, address the concern, then soft close again. Don't push to hard close when they're hesitating. That's when you sound pushy. Address what's holding them back. Answer their concern. Then soft close again. "I understand you're worried about cost. Let me show you how this actually saves money. Does that help?" Then soft close: "Should I check availability?"

The soft close is the bridge. The hard close is the destination. You can't skip the bridge. You can't stay on the bridge forever. You need to cross it to get where you're going. Soft closes build momentum. Hard closes capture commitment. Both are necessary. Neither works alone.

Hard close examples that work: "What's the best email for you?" "Are you using a credit or debit card?" "What's the best name for the account?" These are assumptive. They assume the sale is happening. They don't ask permission—they collect information. That's the difference between soft and hard. Soft asks. Hard assumes.

The sequence is everything. Soft close. Get agreement. Address concerns if needed. Soft close again. Get stronger agreement. Then hard close. Collect information. Don't rush it. Don't drag it out. Find the rhythm. Master the flow. Soft to hard, not hard to soft.
