# Types of Soft Closes
**Estimated read: 3 minutes**

Different situations need different closes. Master these types and you'll always have the right tool for the moment.

The Urgency Close creates time pressure without being fake. "This is the best time to get started because..." "I'm only in the neighborhood today." "The trucks are already here." These work because they're true. You are in the neighborhood today. The trucks are nearby. Frame it as opportunity, not manipulation. Urgency works when they're on the fence. It helps them decide. But don't fake urgency. Real urgency is powerful. Fake urgency is transparent.

The Bandwagon Close uses social proof in action. "If I can get you set up with your neighbor Susan, it'll help me out—how does that sound?" "Most of your neighbors went with the full package." These work because people follow what others do. When they know neighbors are doing it, it feels safer. It feels normal. It feels like the right choice. Bandwagon works when they're skeptical. It proves you're legitimate. It proves others trust you.

The Option Close gives them a choice between two yeses. "Do you want me to start in the front or back?" "Does morning or evening work better for the install?" "Would you like my guy to park out front or in the driveway?" These work because they're not asking if—they're asking which. When you give them options, they're choosing between yeses, not yes or no. Option closes work when they're interested but indecisive. They help them move forward by making small decisions.

The Responsibility Close gives them a small task that assumes the sale. "Can you make sure the dog is put away when my tech arrives?" "Can you leave the gate unlocked for us?" These work because they're practical. They're about logistics, not commitment. But by asking them to do something, you're assuming the sale is happening. Responsibility closes work when they're close but need a nudge. They make the sale feel real and practical.

The Sincerity Close is your last resort—pull at the relationship. "Let me prove to you that you're going to love this. Give me an honest try." "I know you're going to love me—just give me a shot." These work because they're personal. They're about trust. They're about the relationship you've built. Sincerity closes work when nothing else has. They're your Hail Mary. Use them sparingly, but use them when you need them.

Each close type has its moment. Urgency for the fence-sitters. Bandwagon for the skeptics. Option for the indecisive. Responsibility for the almost-there. Sincerity for the relationship-focused. Master them all, and you'll always have the right close for the right moment.
