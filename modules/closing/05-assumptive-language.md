# Assumptive Language
**Estimated read: 2 minutes**

Assumptive language: speaking as if the sale is already happening. It shifts their mindset from "Should I?" to "How does this work?"

Instead of "Would you like to..." say "When we get you set up..." Instead of "If you decide to go with us..." say "Once my tech comes out..." The difference is subtle but powerful. One phrase gives them an out. The other assumes forward motion.

Assumptive language shifts their mindset from "Should I?" to "How does this work?" When you speak as if it's happening, they start thinking about how it works, not whether they want it. That's the shift that closes deals. They're no longer deciding if—they're deciding how.

It's not trickery—it's confidence. When you use assumptive language, you're showing confidence in your product. You're showing confidence in the value you've built. You're showing confidence that this is the right choice for them. Confidence is contagious. When you're confident, they become confident.

Use assumptive language throughout the pitch, not just at the close. "When my guy comes out, he's going to start with the yard." "You're going to love what we do with your eaves." "After the first service, you'll notice a difference within 48 hours." These phrases assume the sale from the beginning. They create momentum throughout the conversation.

Examples that work: "When my guy comes out, he's going to start with the yard." "You're going to love what we do with your eaves." "After the first service, you'll notice a difference within 48 hours." Each assumes the sale is happening. Each creates forward momentum. Each makes the close feel natural, not forced.

Pair with soft closes: "When we get you on the schedule, does morning or afternoon work better?" This combines assumptive language with a soft close. It assumes they're signing up, but gives them a choice in the details. That's powerful. They're not deciding if—they're deciding when.

Assumptive language only works if your tone matches—confident, not arrogant. If you sound pushy, assumptive language sounds manipulative. If you sound confident, assumptive language sounds natural. Your tone determines whether assumptive language builds trust or breaks it.

The goal: make the sale feel inevitable, not forced. When you use assumptive language throughout, the close feels like the natural next step, not a sudden ask. It feels like completing what you started, not starting something new.
