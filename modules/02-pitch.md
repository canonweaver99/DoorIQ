# The Pitch: Building Value Before Price
**Estimated read: 3 minutes**

Price is the last thing they should think about. If you're talking price before they understand value, you've already lost. Your job is to make them want what you're offering so badly that price becomes a detail, not a dealbreaker.

## Establishing Legitimacy Fast

They don't trust you yet. Fix that in the first 60 seconds. Mention neighbors: "I just finished up at the Johnson's place down the street." Show local knowledge: "I noticed you've got that big oak tree—that's probably attracting pests." Reference something visible: "I see you've got solar panels already—smart move."

Legitimacy isn't about your company's credentials. It's about proving you belong in their neighborhood, you understand their situation, and you're not some random stranger trying to scam them.

## The "What This Does For YOU" Framework

Features are what your product has. Benefits are what your product does for them. Features are boring. Benefits are compelling.

**Pest Control Feature:** "We use a quarterly treatment schedule."
**Benefit:** "You won't have to think about bugs again. Set it and forget it."

**Solar Feature:** "25-year warranty on panels."
**Benefit:** "Your electric bill is locked in for the next 25 years. No more rate hikes."

**Internet Feature:** "Gigabit speeds available."
**Benefit:** "Your whole family can stream, game, and work from home without anyone lagging."

**Home Security Feature:** "24/7 monitoring."
**Benefit:** "You can sleep knowing someone's watching your home even when you're not there."

See the difference? Features are facts. Benefits are feelings. Sell feelings, not facts.

## Creating the Mental Picture

Make them visualize the problem first, then the solution. Don't just say "pests are annoying." Paint the picture: "You're having dinner with your family, and a roach crawls across the table. Your kids are grossed out, your wife's embarrassed, and you're frustrated because you thought you'd dealt with this."

Then flip to the solution: "Imagine never worrying about that again. You come home, the house is clean, and you can focus on what matters—your family, not bugs."

The problem picture creates urgency. The solution picture creates desire. Both together create a sale.

## Adjusting Your Depth

Not everyone wants the full pitch. Some people are ready to buy in 30 seconds. Others need 10 minutes. Read their engagement level.

**High engagement:** They're asking questions, nodding, leaning in. Go deeper. Show more value. Build more desire.

**Low engagement:** They're checking their phone, looking away, giving one-word answers. Keep it short. Hit the high points. Get to the close faster.

**Medium engagement:** They're listening but not excited. Find what matters to them. Ask: "What's your biggest concern with [problem]?" Then tailor your pitch to that specific concern.

## Never List Every Feature

You've got 20 features. They care about maybe three. Figure out which three matter to them, and focus there. Save the rest for objections.

If you list everything, you sound like you're reading a brochure. If you focus on what matters to them, you sound like you understand their situation. Guess which one closes more deals?

## Value Statements That Work

**Pest Control:** "Most people don't realize that one untreated home affects the whole neighborhood. We're doing a block-wide program that keeps everyone protected—including you."

**Solar:** "Your electric bill is going up every year. Solar locks in your rate for the next 25 years. It's like buying electricity at today's prices for the next quarter-century."

**Internet:** "You're probably paying for speeds you're not getting. We guarantee the speeds we advertise, or we refund the difference."

**Home Security:** "Most break-ins happen during the day when people think they're safe. Our system protects you 24/7, whether you're home or not."

Each statement focuses on a specific benefit they can relate to. Not generic "we're the best." Specific "here's what this does for you."

Before your next pitch, write down three benefits (not features) of your product. Practice explaining each one in one sentence. Use those three sentences in your next conversation and watch how much more engaged they become.
