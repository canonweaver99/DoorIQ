# DoorIQ Selling Points

## Competitive Advantages Over Existing Sales Training Tools

### üéØ **Custom FSM with Intelligent Terminal States**
- **What We Do**: Custom finite state machine with terminal states based on logic you define (rejected, advanced, closed), plus hidden objectives
- **Why It's Better**: Many tools give feedback generically, but don't allow you to specify rules like "only advanced if ROI quantified AND budget range discussed"
- **Impact**: More realistic and measurable training outcomes that mirror real sales processes

### üß† **RAG-Style Product Knowledge Integration**
- **What We Do**: RAG-style product/offer knowledge integrated so the prospect persona responds with accurate product info and real artifacts
- **Why It's Better**: Many tools don't let you inject your own knowledge base so deeply into the conversation flow
- **Impact**: Prospects can answer detailed questions about your actual products, pricing, and processes

### üìä **Complete Traceability + Structured Rubric Breakdown**
- **What We Do**: Complete traceability with rubric breakdown (discovery, value, objection handling, CTA) including specific missed opportunities
- **Why It's Better**: Some tools provide feedback, but possibly less structured or less transparent about scoring methodology
- **Impact**: Sales reps get actionable, specific feedback they can immediately apply

### üé≠ **Advanced Scenario Generation with Persona Memory**
- **What We Do**: Flexibility in scenario generation with persona memory, variations in industry, urgency, buying process, hidden goals
- **Why It's Better**: Most tools use static scenarios or simple personality types
- **Impact**: More realistic training that adapts to different customer types and situations

### üîß **Developer-Friendly Extensibility**
- **What We Do**: Complete control over every aspect - FSM logic, evaluation criteria, persona behaviors, knowledge base
- **Why It's Better**: Existing tools may force you into their decision constraints or pricing limits
- **Impact**: Can customize for any industry, sales process, or training methodology

### üè† **Door-to-Door Sales Specialization**
- **What We Do**: Purpose-built for door-to-door sales with realistic homeowner personas, objections, and conversation flows
- **Why It's Better**: Most sales training tools focus on B2B or phone sales, not the unique challenges of door-to-door
- **Impact**: Training that actually prepares reps for real homeowner interactions

## Technical Differentiators

### **Intelligent Conversation Management**
- Dual LLM architecture: Prospect (role-play) + Evaluator (grading)
- Context-aware state transitions based on conversation content
- Real-time performance metrics during conversation
- Natural conversation flow with voice activity detection

- Ready for Atlas Vector Search integration
- Scalable API design

### **Realistic Training Scenarios**
- Multiple homeowner personas (family, elderly, professional)
- Industry-specific objections and concerns
- Authentic pricing and service information
- Safety-focused value propositions
