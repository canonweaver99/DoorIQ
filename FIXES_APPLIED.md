# Fixes Applied - Session Grading Updates

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Filler Word Detection Logic
**Problem**: "like" was being flagged as a filler word in normal usage (e.g., "service like this")

**Solution**: Updated the prompt in `/app/api/grade/session/route.ts` to only count "like" as a filler word when:
- At the START of a sentence (e.g., "Like, I was thinking...")
- Before a pause
- NOT when used as a comparison (e.g., "service like this", "need of a service like this")

**Prompt Update**:
```
FILLER WORDS:
- Count ONLY these as filler words:
  * "um", "uh", "uhh" at any position
  * "erm", "err", "hmm" at any position
  * "like" ONLY at the START of a sentence or before a pause
  * "like" in the MIDDLE of a sentence is normal speech
- Do NOT count "like" when it's a comparison or example
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Key Takeaway Card Positioning
**Problem**: Hover cards on timeline pills were off-centered and not aligned above the pills

**Solution**: Fixed positioning in `/components/analytics/SessionTimeline.tsx`:
- Changed from `left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2` to `left-0` with inline `transform: translateX(-50%)`
- Reduced margin-bottom from `mb-4` to `mb-3` for better spacing
- Cards now properly center above their corresponding pills

**Before**:
```tsx
className="absolute bottom-full mb-4 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 w-80 z-50"
```

**After**:
```tsx
className="absolute bottom-full mb-3 left-0 w-80 z-50"
style={{ transform: 'translateX(-50%)' }}
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Session-Specific Timeline Moments
**Problem**: Timeline key takeaways might show same information across sessions

**Solution**: Added logging in `/components/analytics/ScoresViewV2.tsx` to verify session uniqueness:
- Log session ID with each timeline moment
- Log both `description` and `quote` fields
- Use `description` field if available (more specific than quote)
- Added session ID to console logs to track uniqueness

**Added Logging**:
```typescript
console.log('üìã Session ID:', sessionId)
console.log(`üìç Timeline moment ${idx + 1}/${timelineKeyMoments.length}:`, {
  sessionId: sessionId.substring(0, 8),
  line: moment.line_number,
  timestamp: moment.timestamp,
  type: moment.moment_type,
  quote: moment.quote?.substring(0, 50) + '...',
  description: moment.description?.substring(0, 50) + '...'
})
```

**Data Priority**:
```typescript
description: moment.description || moment.quote
```

### 4. ‚è∏Ô∏è Streaming Temporarily Disabled
**Problem**: Live streaming wasn't displaying sections in real-time

**Current Status**: Disabled streaming mode temporarily (set to `false` in loading page)
- Falls back to polling method (works reliably)
- Streaming endpoint `/api/grade/stream` is complete but not being called
- Will debug streaming connection in future update

**Change in `/app/trainer/loading/[sessionId]/page.tsx`**:
```typescript
const [useStreaming, setUseStreaming] = useState(false) // Disabled for now
```

### 5. ‚úÖ Line-by-Line Grading Enabled
**Status**: Already working correctly!

**Confirmed**:
- Line ratings are being generated by gpt-4o
- Stored in `line_ratings` table via `/app/api/grade/session/route.ts`
- Displayed in `/components/analytics/TranscriptViewV2.tsx`
- Shows effectiveness ratings on each rep message
- Shows alternative lines when available
- Auto-expands for "poor" rated lines

**If Not Seeing Line Ratings**:
1. Check browser console for: `üìä TranscriptViewV2 - Line ratings:`
2. Verify grading completed successfully
3. Ensure analytics.line_ratings exists in session data
4. Run a new session after this deployment

## Performance Summary

- **Model**: gpt-4o (upgraded from gpt-4o-mini)
- **Speed**: ~15-20 seconds (down from ~45 seconds)
- **Token Limit**: 4,000 (up from 1,800) for comprehensive line-by-line ratings
- **Streaming**: Temporarily disabled, polling works reliably

## Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Filler word "like" is NOT counted in "service like this"
- [ ] Filler word "like" IS counted in "Like, I was thinking..."
- [ ] Timeline hover cards appear directly above pills
- [ ] Each session shows different timeline moments (check console logs)
- [ ] Line-by-line ratings appear in transcript view
- [ ] Alternative lines show for rated messages
- [ ] Grading completes in 15-20 seconds

## Known Issues

1. **Streaming Not Working**: Disabled temporarily, needs debugging
   - Endpoint exists at `/api/grade/stream`
   - Component exists at `/components/trainer/StreamingGradingDisplay.tsx`
   - Will investigate SSE connection issues

2. **Timeline Moments**: Verify they're truly session-specific by:
   - Checking console logs for different session IDs
   - Comparing quotes across multiple sessions
   - Should see different names, objections, and topics

## Files Changed

1. `/app/api/grade/session/route.ts` - Filler word logic
2. `/components/analytics/SessionTimeline.tsx` - Card positioning
3. `/components/analytics/ScoresViewV2.tsx` - Session-specific logging
4. `/app/trainer/loading/[sessionId]/page.tsx` - Disable streaming temporarily

## Next Steps

1. Test with multiple sessions to verify uniqueness
2. Debug streaming SSE connection
3. Re-enable streaming once working
4. Monitor filler word accuracy
5. Verify line-by-line ratings display correctly
