### Deployment Steps

1. **Run Database Migration**:
   ```sql
   -- In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
   -- lib/supabase/migrations/017_update_all_agents.sql
   ```

2. **Deploy Frontend**:
   - Code is already pushed to GitHub (commit `09436aa`)
   - Redeploy your Vercel/hosting platform
   - Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)

3. **Test**:
   - Visit trainer page
   - Should see all 12 new agents
   - Select any agent and start a session
   - Verify the correct ElevenLabs agent responds

### Session Handling Status

✅ **Session ID Corruption Fix**:
- Implemented workaround using API endpoint `/api/sessions/recent`
- Fetches correct session ID from database before redirect
- Bypasses Supabase client UUID corruption issue

✅ **Background Grading**:
- Sessions grade in background after ending
- Instant redirect to analytics
- Scores populate within 10-15 seconds

✅ **Virtual Money System**:
- Automatically tracks earnings when deals are closed
- Updates leaderboard in real-time

### Known Issues

⚠️ **UUID Corruption** (Workaround in place):
- Supabase JS client corrupts UUIDs with certain hex patterns
- Workaround: Fetch session ID via API instead of client
- Root cause: Hex sequences in UUIDs interpreted as escape codes

⚠️ **Agent Disconnections**:
- Occasional ElevenLabs WebRTC connection drops
- Not a code issue - provider stability

### Files Modified

- `lib/supabase/migrations/017_update_all_agents.sql` (new)
- `components/trainer/personas.ts` (updated)
- `app/trainer/page.tsx` (updated)
- `app/api/sessions/recent/route.ts` (new - for session ID workaround)

### Git Commits
