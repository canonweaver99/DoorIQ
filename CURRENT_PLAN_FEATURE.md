# 🎯 Current Plan Feature - Complete!

## What's Been Implemented

The pricing page now dynamically shows which plan a user is currently on, replacing the purchase/trial button with a "Current Plan" indicator.

## Features Added

### 1. **Dynamic Plan Detection**
- ✅ Automatically detects if user has active subscription
- ✅ Shows "Free" as current plan for non-subscribed users
- ✅ Shows "Individual" as current plan for subscribed users (including trial)
- ✅ Uses `useSubscription()` hook for real-time status

### 2. **Current Plan Button**
- ✅ Replaces "Start Free Trial" or "Get Started" buttons
- ✅ Shows crown icon (👑) with "Current Plan" text
- ✅ Beautiful green gradient styling (`from-green-600 to-emerald-600`)
- ✅ Non-clickable (cursor-default)
- ✅ Prevents accidental purchases of same plan

### 3. **Current Plan Badge**
- ✅ Green gradient badge at top of card
- ✅ Shows "Current Plan" with star icon
- ✅ Replaces "Most Popular" badge when it's the current plan
- ✅ Stands out visually with shadow

### 4. **Smart Popular Badge**
- ✅ "Most Popular" badge is hidden on current plan
- ✅ Prevents confusion (don't show "popular" on what they already have)
- ✅ Shows on other plans as appropriate

## Visual Design

### Current Plan Card:
- **Badge**: Green gradient with white text and star icon
- **Button**: Green gradient, non-clickable, with crown icon
- **Styling**: `bg-gradient-to-r from-green-600 to-emerald-600`

### Free Plan (when current):
```
┌────────────────────────────┐
│    ⭐ Current Plan          │
├────────────────────────────┤
│         Free               │
│         $0                 │
│                            │
│    👑 Current Plan         │ ← Green gradient button
└────────────────────────────┘
```

### Individual Plan (when current):
```
┌────────────────────────────┐
│    ⭐ Current Plan          │
├────────────────────────────┤
│      Individual            │
│         $20                │
│                            │
│    👑 Current Plan         │ ← Green gradient button
└────────────────────────────┘
```

## How It Works

### Logic Flow:
1. Page loads and fetches user subscription via `useSubscription()`
2. `isCurrentPlan()` function checks:
   - If "Free" plan: Returns `true` if no active subscription
   - If "Individual" plan: Returns `true` if has active subscription (including trial)
3. Button text changes to crown icon + "Current Plan"
4. Button gets green gradient styling
5. onClick handler becomes empty function (no action)
6. Badge shows "Current Plan" instead of "Most Popular"

### Code Structure:
```tsx
const subscription = useSubscription()
const hasActiveSubscription = subscription.hasActiveSubscription

const isCurrentPlan = (planName: string) => {
  if (planName === "Free" && !hasActiveSubscription && !subscription.loading) {
    return true
  }
  if (planName === "Individual" && hasActiveSubscription) {
    return true
  }
  return false
}
```

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Free User
1. Sign in without subscription
2. Go to `/pricing`
3. **Free plan** shows: 👑 "Current Plan" with green button
4. Individual plan shows: "Start Free Trial"

### Test Scenario 2: Premium User (Trial or Active)
1. Sign in with active subscription or trial
2. Go to `/pricing`
3. Free plan shows: "Get Started Free"
4. **Individual plan** shows: 👑 "Current Plan" with green button

✅ **Prevents duplicate purchases** - Can't buy same plan twice
✅ **Clear visual feedback** - Green = active/current
✅ **Responsive** - Updates in real-time as subscription changes
