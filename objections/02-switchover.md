# Switchover Objection

## Why They Say This

This is actually your warmest lead. They already buy this service—they're not skeptical about whether they need it. They're just comfortable with what they have. Your job is to make switching feel like an upgrade, not a hassle.

## The Mistake Most Reps Make

They bash the current provider. "Oh, those guys are terrible!" That makes the homeowner defensive. They chose that company—you're insulting their judgment. Never bash. Elevate.

## The Framework

Equalize first: "I'm sure they do a good job." Then differentiate: "Here's what we do differently..." Find out how long they've been with them—long-term customers often pay more and get less attention. Use assumptive language: "I'm sure you've been with them a couple years now, right?" Make switching feel like an upgrade, not a betrayal.

## Example Scripts

**Pest Control Example**
> **Homeowner:** "I already have Terminix."
> **Rep:** "Oh nice—I'm sure they're doing a good job for you. How long have you been with them?"
> **Homeowner:** "About three years."
> **Rep:** "Got it. So you're probably paying around $80-100 a month, right? Here's what we do differently: We do everything they do, plus we offer same-day service calls, a satisfaction guarantee, and we're local so you can actually talk to the owner if you need to. Same price, better service. Want me to show you what we offer?"
> **Homeowner:** "I guess I could look."
> **Rep:** "Perfect—let me check what we can do for your home."

**Internet Example**
> **Homeowner:** "I'm happy with my current provider."
> **Rep:** "That's great—I'm glad they're working for you. Quick question: Are you getting the speeds you're paying for?"
> **Homeowner:** "I'm not sure, honestly."
> **Rep:** "Most people aren't. Here's what we do differently: We guarantee the speeds we advertise, or we refund the difference. Plus, we're local, so if you have an issue, you talk to a real person, not a call center. Same price, better service. Want me to check what speeds you're actually getting?"
> **Homeowner:** "Sure, why not."
> **Rep:** "Great—let me run a quick test."
