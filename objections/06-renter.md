# Renter Objection
**Estimated read: 2 minutes**

## Why They Say This

They don't own the home, so they think they can't make decisions about services. Sometimes that's true. Sometimes it's not. Your job is to qualify quickly, then either pivot to the landlord or find out if they handle services themselves. Don't waste time on someone who truly can't decide.

## The Mistake Most Reps Make

They give up immediately. "Oh, you're renting? Okay, thanks!" Then they leave. Or they push: "Can't you just decide?" That doesn't work. Neither does spending 10 minutes trying to convince someone who can't make the decision.

## The Framework

Qualify quickly: "Do you handle any of the home services, or does the landlord?" If they handle services, pivot to value. If the landlord handles everything, pivot to landlord contact: "Perfect, can you shoot them a quick text?" If they pay utilities, they may pay for services too. Transferability angle: "If you move, the service moves with you." Know when to walk—don't waste time on someone who truly can't decide.

## Example Scripts

**Pest Control Example**
> **Homeowner:** "I'm just renting."
> **Rep:** "Got it—do you handle pest control, or does your landlord?"
> **Homeowner:** "I usually handle it myself."
> **Rep:** "Perfect. So you're probably spending $20-30 every few months on sprays, right? Our service is about the same cost, but you get professional treatment, a guarantee, and if you move, you can transfer the service to your new place. Plus, you never have to think about bugs. Make sense?"
> **Homeowner:** "I guess so."
> **Rep:** "Want me to show you what we can do?"

**Internet Example**
> **Homeowner:** "I'm renting, so I can't really decide."
> **Rep:** "Totally understand. Quick question: Do you pay for internet, or does your landlord?"
> **Homeowner:** "I pay for it."
> **Rep:** "Perfect. So you're already making that decision. Here's the thing: We guarantee the speeds we advertise, or we refund the difference. Plus, if you move, you can transfer the service. Same price, better service. Want me to check what speeds you're actually getting?"
> **Homeowner:** "I guess I could look."
> **Rep:** "Great—let me run a quick test."
