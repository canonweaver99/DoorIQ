# Spouse Check Objection
**Estimated read: 2 minutes**

## Why They Say This

Often it's a smokescreen to get you off the door. Sometimes it's real. Your job is to figure out which one, then either create urgency or set a hard callback time. Most reps take this at face value and leave. Don't be most reps.

## The Mistake Most Reps Make

They accept it immediately. "Oh, okay, I'll come back later!" Then they never come back. Or they pressure: "Can't you just decide?" That sounds pushy. Neither works.

## The Framework

Validate the decision-making process: "Of course, you have to do what's best for your family." Then qualify: "If they were here right now and loved it, would you move forward?" If yes, create urgency—the deal, the schedule, the trucks in the area. If no, set a hard callback time and actually return. Don't leave without a commitment.

## Example Scripts

**Solar Example**
> **Homeowner:** "I need to talk to my spouse first."
> **Rep:** "Of course—you have to do what's best for your family. Quick question: If they were here right now and loved it, would you move forward?"
> **Homeowner:** "Yeah, probably."
> **Rep:** "Perfect. Here's the thing—I'm only in your neighborhood today, and we've got a group discount that ends tonight. Plus, our installation schedule fills up fast. Can you shoot them a quick text and see if they can come home? Or I can come back at 7pm when they're home."
> **Homeowner:** "Let me text them."
> **Rep:** "Great—while you do that, let me show you what we're offering."

**Security Example**
> **Homeowner:** "My husband needs to be here for this decision."
> **Rep:** "Totally understand—this is a big decision. If he were here right now and loved it, would you move forward?"
> **Homeowner:** "I think so, yeah."
> **Rep:** "Perfect. I'm actually doing a few houses in your neighborhood today, so I can swing back by tonight when he's home. What time does he usually get home?"
> **Homeowner:** "Around 6."
> **Rep:** "Perfect—I'll come back at 6:30. In the meantime, let me show you what we're offering so you can show him when I come back."
