# DIY Objection

## Why They Say This

They think they can do it themselves. They're not wrong—they probably can do something. But they can't do what you do. Your job is to respect their effort, then show them the gap between DIY and professional service.

## The Mistake Most Reps Make

They make them feel dumb. "You can't do this yourself!" That's insulting. They've probably tried, and it might have worked a little. Don't invalidate their effort—show them why professional is worth the small difference in price.

## The Framework

Respect first: "I totally get wanting to handle it yourself." Then show the gap: professional-grade products they can't access, time investment, warranty protection. The key: "For a small difference in price, you get 10x the coverage." Don't make DIY feel stupid—make professional feel like the obvious upgrade.

## Example Scripts

**Pest Control Example**
> **Homeowner:** "I just buy stuff from Home Depot and do it myself."
> **Rep:** "I totally get that—saves money, right? Quick question: How often do you have to reapply?"
> **Homeowner:** "Every few months, I guess."
> **Rep:** "So you're spending $20-30 every few months, plus your time, plus if it doesn't work, you're out the money. Our service is about the same cost, but you get professional-grade products you can't buy at the store, a guarantee that if bugs come back we come back for free, and you never have to think about it. For the same money, you get 10x the coverage. Make sense?"
> **Homeowner:** "I never thought about it that way."
> **Rep:** "Want me to show you what we can do?"

**Solar Example**
> **Homeowner:** "Why wouldn't I just buy panels myself?"
> **Rep:** "You absolutely could—and some people do. Here's the thing: When you buy panels yourself, you're buying retail. When you go through us, you're buying wholesale, plus we handle all the permits, installation, warranties, and maintenance. Plus, if something goes wrong, you call us, not the manufacturer. For about the same price, you get the whole package. Does that make sense?"
> **Homeowner:** "I guess so."
> **Rep:** "Want me to show you the difference?"
