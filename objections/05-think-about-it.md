# Think About It Objection
**Estimated read: 2 minutes**

## Why They Say This

Translation: "You haven't given me a reason to decide right now." They're not going to think about it—they're going to forget about it. This is your last chance to create clarity and urgency. Most reps accept this and leave. Don't be most reps.

## The Mistake Most Reps Make

They accept it. "Okay, think about it and let me know!" Then they never hear from them again. Or they pressure: "What's there to think about?" That sounds pushy. Neither works.

## The Framework

Isolate the real concern: "Totally fair—what specifically do you want to think over?" Create clarity: "Is it the price, the service, or something else?" Once you know what they're actually concerned about, address it. Then create soft urgency: "I'm only in the neighborhood today..." Offer to answer any remaining questions right now. Don't leave without addressing the real concern.

## Example Scripts

**Internet Example**
> **Homeowner:** "I need to think about it."
> **Rep:** "Totally fair—what specifically do you want to think over? Is it the price, the service, or something else?"
> **Homeowner:** "I guess I just want to make sure it's worth switching."
> **Rep:** "I get that. Let me ask you this: Are you happy with your current speeds?"
> **Homeowner:** "Not really, no."
> **Rep:** "So you're paying for something you're not happy with. We guarantee the speeds we advertise, or we refund the difference. Plus, I'm only in your neighborhood today, so if you want to switch, now's the time. Want me to check what speeds you're actually getting?"
> **Homeowner:** "Okay, sure."
> **Rep:** "Perfect—let me run a quick test."

**Security Example**
> **Homeowner:** "Let me think about it."
> **Rep:** "Of course—what specifically do you want to think over?"
> **Homeowner:** "I don't know, just everything."
> **Rep:** "Is it the price, the service, or something else?"
> **Homeowner:** "I guess I'm just not sure if I need it."
> **Rep:** "I get that. Here's the thing: Most break-ins happen during the day when people think they're safe. Our system protects you 24/7, whether you're home or not. Plus, I'm only in your neighborhood today, so if you want to get set up, now's the time. Want me to show you what we offer?"
> **Homeowner:** "Okay, show me."
> **Rep:** "Perfect—let me walk you through it."
