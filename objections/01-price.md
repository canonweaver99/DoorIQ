# Price Objection
**Estimated read: 2 minutes**

## Why They Say This

They haven't seen enough value yet. This isn't a "them" problem—it's a "you" problem. You haven't connected the price to what they actually care about. Price objections are buying signals. They're interested, they just need to understand why it's worth it.

## The Mistake Most Reps Make

They defend the price. "It's actually a great deal!" or "You get what you pay for!" That sounds defensive and makes the price seem high. Never defend. Reframe.

## The Framework

Don't talk about cost—talk about investment. Break it down to something relatable (per month, per day, per service). Compare it to what they're already spending or losing. Ask: "Have you ever priced this out before?" That question makes them think about the real cost of not having it.

## Example Scripts

**Solar Example**
> **Homeowner:** "That's way too expensive."
> **Rep:** "I get it—it's a big number. Let me ask you this: What are you paying for electricity right now?"
> **Homeowner:** "About $200 a month."
> **Rep:** "So over 25 years, that's $60,000. This system costs less than that, and after it's paid off, your electricity is free. Plus, your rate never goes up. Does that make sense?"
> **Homeowner:** "Yeah, I guess so."
> **Rep:** "Want me to show you the numbers?"

**Pest Control Example**
> **Homeowner:** "I can't afford that."
> **Rep:** "Of course price matters. Quick question—do you buy pest control products from the store?"
> **Homeowner:** "Yeah, sometimes."
> **Rep:** "So you're probably spending $20-30 every few months on sprays and traps, right? Over a year, that's $100-150. Our service is about the same, but you get professional-grade treatment, a guarantee, and you never have to think about it. For the same money, you get 10x the coverage. Make sense?"
> **Homeowner:** "I never thought about it that way."
> **Rep:** "Want me to show you what we can do?"
