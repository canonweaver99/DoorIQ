# Analytics & Feedback System Implementation

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

We've successfully implemented a comprehensive analytics and feedback system for DoorIQ with the following features:

### 1. Dual-Page Analytics View (`/analytics/[sessionId]`)
- **Transcript View**: Full conversation transcript with line-by-line effectiveness ratings
  - Green borders = Excellent responses
  - Yellow borders = Good/Average responses  
  - Red borders = Poor responses
  - Hover to see AI-suggested alternative phrases
- **Scores View**: Overall performance metrics and detailed feedback
  - Large overall score (0-100) with star rating
  - 4 main metrics: Rapport, Discovery, Objection Handling, Closing
  - Additional metrics: Introduction, Listening, Safety
  - Strengths, improvements, and pro tips sections

### 2. OpenAI-Powered Grading (`/api/grade/session`)
- Uses GPT-4o-mini for intelligent conversation analysis
- Grades every sales rep line with effectiveness ratings
- Suggests alternative phrases for improvement
- Calculates comprehensive performance scores
- Integrates knowledge base context for company-specific grading

### 3. Enhanced Database Schema
- **Migration 023**: Updates `live_sessions` table
  - All line ratings stored in `analytics` JSONB column
  - Added `needs_discovery_score` column
  - No separate line_sessions table needed
- **Knowledge Base Table**: Stores training materials
  - Supports PDF, TXT, MD, DOC, DOCX files
  - Used to provide context during grading

### 4. Knowledge Base System (`/knowledge-base`)
- Upload training materials and documentation
- Files stored in Supabase Storage
- Content extracted and used during AI grading
- Improves grading accuracy with company-specific context

### 5. Sessions List (`/sessions`)
- Shows all training sessions with scores
- Filter by week, month, or all time
- Quick insights and performance indicators
- Virtual earnings display
- Links to detailed analytics

## Technical Implementation

### Components Created
1. `TranscriptView.tsx` - Interactive transcript with hover alternatives
2. `ScoresView.tsx` - Performance metrics and feedback display
3. Knowledge base upload page with file management

### API Endpoints
1. `GET /api/sessions/[sessionId]` - Fetch session details
2. `POST /api/grade/session` - Trigger AI grading
3. Existing session endpoints continue to work

### Database Changes
- Migration 023: Adds knowledge_base table
- Updates live_sessions analytics structure
- No breaking changes to existing data

## Usage Flow

1. **During Training**: Session transcript saved to `live_sessions.full_transcript`
2. **After Training**: 
   - User redirected to analytics page
   - AI grading triggered automatically if not already graded
   - Line-by-line ratings generated and stored
3. **View Results**:
   - Toggle between transcript and scores views
   - Hover over lines to see improvement suggestions
   - Review overall performance metrics
4. **Knowledge Base**:
   - Upload training materials
   - AI references these during grading
   - More accurate, context-aware feedback

## Key Features

✅ Line-by-line effectiveness ratings with color coding
