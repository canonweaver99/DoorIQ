# Simplified Grading System

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Version:** 5.3-simplified  
**Status:** Active

## 🎯 What Changed

### Simplified Prompt
**Before:** ~2,900 token prompt with detailed instructions
**After:** ~300 token prompt focusing on essentials

### Faster Response
- Reduced max_tokens: 4000 → 2000
- Lower temperature: 0.7 → 0.5 (more consistent)
- Simpler instructions = faster processing
- **Expected time: 5-8 seconds** (was 10-15)

### Core Focus
**Required Fields Only:**
- 5 core scores (overall, rapport, discovery, objection_handling, closing)
- Line-by-line effectiveness ratings
- 2-3 strengths
- 2-3 improvements
- Sale status + earnings (if closed)

**Optional Fields** (nice-to-have, not required):
- Enhanced metrics
- Objection analysis
- Coaching plan
- Deal details

### Better Error Handling
- Parse errors are caught and logged
- Partial responses still save
- Graceful degradation if optional fields missing
