# Enhanced Grading System Implementation

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… Complete

## Overview

We've successfully enhanced the DoorIQ grading system by adding 5 new performance metrics on top of the existing 4 core metrics, providing deeper insights into sales rep performance.

## What's New

### 5 New Performance Metrics

1. **Speaking Pace (Words Per Minute)**
   - Calculates WPM for each rep response
   - Optimal range: 140-160 WPM (100 score)
   - Penalties: <120 WPM or >200 WPM
   - Tracks pace variations during key moments

2. **Filler Words Count**
   - Counts: um, uh, like, you know, so, basically, actually, literally, etc.
   - Calculates filler density percentage
   - Identifies clusters during transitions/uncertainty
   - Lower density = higher score

3. **Question vs. Statement Ratio**
   - Target: 30-40% questions for optimal score
   - Categorizes question types (open-ended, closed, discovery, trial closes)
   - Penalizes interrogation style or zero questions
   - Tracks question frequency and spacing

4. **Active Listening Indicators**
   - Detects acknowledgments, empathy statements, paraphrasing
   - Examples: "absolutely", "I understand", "that makes sense"
   - Measures response relevance and topic continuity
   - Penalizes non-sequiturs and generic responses

5. **Assumptive Language Usage**
   - Compares assumptive vs tentative language
   - Assumptive: "when we", "after treatment", "your technician"
   - Tentative: "if you decide", "should you choose", "maybe"
   - Higher confidence ratio = higher score

### Enhanced Context for Existing 4 Metrics

1. **Rapport Building (/100)**
   - Detailed criteria: personal connection, local references, name usage, mirror language
   - Weighted scoring: greeting quality (20%), connection depth (30%), authenticity (25%), customer comfort (25%)

2. **Discovery (/100)**
   - Comprehensive question tracking: problem identification, pain points, timeline, severity
   - Quality factors: open-ended ratio, follow-up depth, listening duration
   - Weighted: question quantity (25%), quality (35%), problem identification (40%)

3. **Objection Handling (/100)**
   - Identifies 11+ objection types: price, spouse decision, time delays, etc.
   - Response quality: acknowledge-validate-respond, feel-felt-found, value building
   - Weighted: response effectiveness (40%), empathy (30%), value reinforcement (30%)

4. **Closing Technique (/100)**
   - Detects 10+ closing methods: assumptive, alternative choice, urgency, scarcity
   - Key phrases tracking: "starting tomorrow", "choosing between", "makes sense right"
   - Weighted: attempt clarity (30%), confidence (30%), urgency (20%), next steps (20%)

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
- **Migration 028**: Adds 10 new columns to `live_sessions` table
  - 5 score columns: `speaking_pace_score`, `filler_words_score`, etc.
  - 5 data columns: `speaking_pace_data`, `filler_words_data`, etc.
  - Updated overall score calculation to average all 9 metrics

### API Updates
- **Grading Route** (`/api/grade/session`)
  - Enhanced OpenAI prompt with detailed scoring criteria
  - Extracts and saves all 9 metric scores
  - Stores detailed metric data in JSONB columns
  - Version bumped to 4.0-enhanced

### UI Updates
- **ScoresView Component**
  - New "Enhanced Performance Metrics" section
  - Displays all 5 new metrics with icons
  - Shows detailed breakdowns on hover
  - Responsive grid layout

### OpenAI Integration
- Comprehensive prompt engineering for accurate scoring
- Line-by-line analysis includes WPM and filler word detection
- Returns structured JSON with all metrics and detailed breakdowns

## How to Use

### 1. Apply the Migration
```bash
./scripts/apply-enhanced-grading-migration.sh
```

### 2. Re-grade Existing Sessions
To calculate new metrics for existing sessions:
```bash
node scripts/test-grading.js [sessionId]
```

### 3. View Enhanced Analytics
Navigate to `/analytics/[sessionId]` to see:
- All 9 performance metrics
- Detailed breakdowns for each metric
- Color-coded scoring indicators
- Comprehensive feedback

## Benefits

1. **Deeper Insights**: Beyond basic scoring, understand HOW reps communicate
2. **Objective Metrics**: Data-driven analysis of speaking patterns
3. **Actionable Feedback**: Specific areas for improvement with measurable targets
4. **Comprehensive View**: 9 dimensions of performance vs 4
5. **Training Focus**: Identify specific skills that need development

## Next Steps

1. **Historical Analysis**: Re-grade past sessions to establish baselines
2. **Leaderboard Updates**: Consider adding new metrics to leaderboard views
3. **Trend Analysis**: Track improvement in new metrics over time
4. **Custom Weights**: Allow teams to adjust metric importance
5. **Export Reports**: Include enhanced metrics in performance reports

## Migration Rollback

If needed, you can rollback the enhanced grading:
```sql
-- Remove new columns
ALTER TABLE live_sessions 
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS speaking_pace_score,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS speaking_pace_data,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS filler_words_score,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS filler_words_data,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS question_ratio_score,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS question_ratio_data,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS active_listening_score,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS active_listening_data,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS assumptive_language_score,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS assumptive_language_data;

-- Restore original trigger
-- (Use the trigger from migration 020)
```
