## üåê Environment Variables (CHECK PRODUCTION)

### Required in Production (Vercel/deployment platform):
- [?] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- [?] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- [?] `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- [?] `OPENAI_API_KEY` ‚Üê **CRITICAL for session grading**
- [?] `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`

**How to check**:
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard (or deployment platform)
2. Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. Ensure ALL variables from .env.local are also in production

**Why this matters**:
- Without OPENAI_API_KEY in production, sessions won't get graded
- This is why your 28 sessions show "Not graded"
