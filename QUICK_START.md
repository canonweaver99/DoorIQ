# 🚀 Quick Start - Redesigned DoorIQ

## What Changed?

### ✅ **CRITICAL BUG FIXED**
The live session page now correctly displays the selected homeowner's name (e.g., "Decisive Derek", "Skeptical Sarah") instead of the hardcoded "Austin Rodriguez".

Both the homeowner selection and live session pages have been completely redesigned with:
- Premium SaaS aesthetic (Stripe/Linear/Vercel quality)
- Smooth animations using Framer Motion
- Modern color gradients and glass morphism

## Common Customizations

primary: {
  500: '#6366f1', // Change this
  600: '#4f46e5', // And this
}
```

### Adjust Animation Speed
Edit `lib/theme.ts`:
```typescript
transitions: {
  smooth: 'all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)', // Change 0.3s
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Build Errors
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### Issue: Homeowner Name Still Shows "Austin Rodriguez"
**Check**:
1. URL has `?name=` parameter

3. Clear browser cache

### Issue: Animations Not Working
**Check**:
1. Framer Motion installed: `npm list framer-motion`
2. Browser supports modern CSS
3. Reduced motion not enabled in OS

### Issue: Cards Not Displaying
**Check**:
1. Console for errors
2. Network tab for failed requests
3. Database connection
