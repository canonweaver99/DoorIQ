# Team Performance Chart Update

## Summary
Updated the Team Performance chart in the Manager Panel to display team revenue over time with interactive time period toggles.

## Changes Made

### 1. Changed Chart Type
- **Before**: Line chart showing Team Average, Top Performer, and Industry Average scores
- **After**: Bar chart displaying total team revenue in dollars

### 2. Added Time Period Toggles
Added three toggle options above the chart:
- **Day**: Shows daily earnings for the last 7 days
- **Week**: Shows weekly earnings for the last 6 weeks  
- **Month**: Shows monthly earnings for the last 6 months (default)

The toggle uses an elegant purple-themed selector that matches the dashboard design.

### 3. Data Structure
Created three separate datasets for different time periods (optimized for readability with 6-7 data points):

#### Daily Data (7 days)
- Period labels: Day names (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun)
- Full date shown in tooltip (e.g., "Oct 3")
- Revenue: $3,000 - $7,000 per day
- Includes: repsWhoSold, totalSales

#### Weekly Data (6 weeks)
- Period labels: "Week of [date]" (e.g., "Week of Oct 3")
- Full date ranges in tooltip (e.g., "Oct 3 - Oct 9")
- Revenue: $18,000 - $33,000 per week
- Includes: repsWhoSold, totalSales
- Labels slightly angled (-15°) for better readability

#### Monthly Data (6 months)
- Period labels: Month abbreviations (e.g., Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec, Jan)
- Full month/year shown in tooltip (e.g., "October 2025")
- Revenue: $58,000 - $93,000 per month
- Includes: repsWhoSold, totalSales
- Dynamically generated to show last 6 months from current date

### 4. Visual Design

#### Gradient Fill
- Purple to teal gradient (matching theme)
- Top color: `#8B5CF6` (purple) at 90% opacity
- Bottom color: `#06B6D4` (cyan/teal) at 60% opacity
- Rounded bar corners (8px radius on top)

#### Bar Labels
- Dollar values displayed on top of each bar
- Format: `$X.Xk` (e.g., $4.5k, $88.7k)
- Gray color (`#9CA3AF`) for subtle appearance
- Small font size (10px) to avoid clutter

#### Chart Styling
- Dark theme consistent with dashboard
- Subtle grid lines
- Maximum bar width: 60px
- Appropriate spacing for readability

### 5. Interactive Features

#### Custom Tooltip
When hovering over a bar, displays:
- **Period**: Full date range (for weeks) or period name
- **Revenue**: Total team revenue with proper formatting ($XX,XXX)
- **Reps Who Sold**: Number of team members who made sales
- **Total Sales**: Total number of sales closed

Tooltip styling:
- Semi-transparent dark background
- Border with subtle white glow
- Color-coded text (purple, cyan, green)
- Backdrop blur effect

### 6. Responsive Design

#### X-Axis Handling
- **Day view**: Horizontal labels (7 data points fit comfortably)
- **Week view**: Labels rotated -15° for better readability with longer labels
- **Month view**: Horizontal labels (6 data points)
- Dynamic height adjustment based on view
- Consistent 6-7 data points across all views for clean, readable charts

#### Y-Axis
- Formatted as dollars with "k" suffix ($XXk)
- Automatic scaling based on data range

## Files Modified

### `/components/manager/TeamOverview.tsx`
- Added `useState` import for time period state
- Changed from `LineChart` to `BarChart` in imports
- Added three revenue datasets (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Added `timePeriod` state and `getChartData()` function
- Replaced entire chart section with new bar chart implementation
- Added time period toggle buttons
- Implemented custom tooltip with revenue metrics

## Technical Details

### State Management
```typescript
const [timePeriod, setTimePeriod] = useState<'day' | 'week' | 'month'>('month')
```

### Data Selection
```typescript
const getChartData = () => {
  switch (timePeriod) {
    case 'day': return dailyRevenueData
    case 'week': return weeklyRevenueData
    case 'month': return monthlyRevenueData
    default: return monthlyRevenueData
  }
}
```

### Gradient Definition
```typescript
<linearGradient id="revenueGradient" x1="0" y1="0" x2="0" y2="1">
  <stop offset="0%" stopColor="#8B5CF6" stopOpacity={0.9} />
  <stop offset="100%" stopColor="#06B6D4" stopOpacity={0.6} />
</linearGradient>
```

## How to Test

1. Navigate to the Manager Panel: `/manager`
2. The Team Performance chart should display on the "Team Overview" tab
3. Default view shows monthly revenue (last 6 months)
4. Click "Week" toggle to see last 6 weeks of data
5. Click "Day" toggle to see last 7 days of data
6. Hover over any bar to see detailed metrics:
   - Total revenue for that period
   - Number of reps who sold
   - Total number of sales
7. Notice the clean, readable layout with 6-7 bars regardless of view

## Key Features

✅ Bar chart instead of line chart  
✅ Revenue-focused metrics (not scores)  
✅ Three time period views (Day, Week, Month)  
✅ **Optimized data ranges** (6-7 bars max for better readability)  
✅ Purple/teal gradient matching theme  
✅ Dollar values on top of bars  
✅ Interactive hover tooltip with detailed metrics  
✅ Removed comparison lines (Industry/Team Avg/Top Performer)  
✅ Dark theme consistency  
✅ Smooth transitions and animations  
✅ Responsive design for all screen sizes  
✅ Clean X-axis labels with minimal rotation needed  

## Notes

- Currently using mock/sample data
- In production, you'll want to:
  - Replace mock data with actual revenue from database
  - Fetch data based on selected time period
  - Add loading states during data fetching
  - Consider caching for performance
  - Add error handling for failed data loads

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add date range picker for custom periods
- Export chart data to CSV/PDF
- Add comparison view (e.g., this month vs last month)
- Show revenue growth percentage
- Filter by specific team or region
- Add drill-down functionality to see individual sales
- Show average deal size
- Add revenue targets/goals overlay
