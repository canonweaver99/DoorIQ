# Team Performance Chart Update

## Summary
Updated the Team Performance chart in the Manager Panel to display team revenue over time with interactive time period toggles.

## Changes Made

### 1. Changed Chart Type
- **Before**: Line chart showing Team Average, Top Performer, and Industry Average scores
- **After**: Bar chart displaying total team revenue in dollars

### 2. Added Time Period Toggles
Added three toggle options above the chart:
- **Day**: Shows daily earnings for the last 30 days
- **Week**: Shows weekly earnings for the last 12 weeks  
- **Month**: Shows monthly earnings for the last 12 months (default)

The toggle uses an elegant purple-themed selector that matches the dashboard design.

### 3. Data Structure
Created three separate datasets for different time periods:

#### Daily Data (30 days)
- Period labels: Day names (Mon, Tue, Wed) with occasional dates
- Revenue: $3,000 - $7,000 per day
- Includes: repsWhoSold, totalSales

#### Weekly Data (12 weeks)
- Period labels: Week 1, Week 2, etc.
- Full date ranges in tooltip
- Revenue: $18,000 - $33,000 per week
- Includes: repsWhoSold, totalSales

#### Monthly Data (12 months)
- Period labels: Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.
- Revenue: $58,200 - $92,800 per month
- Includes: repsWhoSold, totalSales

### 4. Visual Design

#### Gradient Fill
- Purple to teal gradient (matching theme)
- Top color: `#8B5CF6` (purple) at 90% opacity
- Bottom color: `#06B6D4` (cyan/teal) at 60% opacity
- Rounded bar corners (8px radius on top)

#### Bar Labels
- Dollar values displayed on top of each bar
- Format: `$X.Xk` (e.g., $4.5k, $88.7k)
- Gray color (`#9CA3AF`) for subtle appearance
- Small font size (10px) to avoid clutter

#### Chart Styling
- Dark theme consistent with dashboard
- Subtle grid lines
- Maximum bar width: 60px
- Appropriate spacing for readability

### 5. Interactive Features

#### Custom Tooltip
When hovering over a bar, displays:
- **Period**: Full date range (for weeks) or period name
- **Revenue**: Total team revenue with proper formatting ($XX,XXX)
- **Reps Who Sold**: Number of team members who made sales
- **Total Sales**: Total number of sales closed

Tooltip styling:
- Semi-transparent dark background
- Border with subtle white glow
- Color-coded text (purple, cyan, green)
- Backdrop blur effect

### 6. Responsive Design

#### X-Axis Handling
- **Day view**: Labels rotated -45° to prevent overlap with 30 data points
- **Week/Month views**: Horizontal labels for better readability
- Dynamic height adjustment based on view

#### Y-Axis
- Formatted as dollars with "k" suffix ($XXk)
- Automatic scaling based on data range

## Files Modified

### `/components/manager/TeamOverview.tsx`
- Added `useState` import for time period state
- Changed from `LineChart` to `BarChart` in imports
- Added three revenue datasets (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Added `timePeriod` state and `getChartData()` function
- Replaced entire chart section with new bar chart implementation
- Added time period toggle buttons
- Implemented custom tooltip with revenue metrics

## Technical Details

### State Management
```typescript
const [timePeriod, setTimePeriod] = useState<'day' | 'week' | 'month'>('month')
```

### Data Selection
```typescript
const getChartData = () => {
  switch (timePeriod) {
    case 'day': return dailyRevenueData
    case 'week': return weeklyRevenueData
    case 'month': return monthlyRevenueData
    default: return monthlyRevenueData
  }
}
```

### Gradient Definition
```typescript
<linearGradient id="revenueGradient" x1="0" y1="0" x2="0" y2="1">
  <stop offset="0%" stopColor="#8B5CF6" stopOpacity={0.9} />
  <stop offset="100%" stopColor="#06B6D4" stopOpacity={0.6} />
</linearGradient>
```

## How to Test

1. Navigate to the Manager Panel: `/manager`
2. The Team Performance chart should display on the "Team Overview" tab
3. Default view shows monthly revenue (12 months)
4. Click "Week" toggle to see 12 weeks of data
5. Click "Day" toggle to see 30 days of data
6. Hover over any bar to see detailed metrics:
   - Total revenue for that period
   - Number of reps who sold
   - Total number of sales

## Key Features

✅ Bar chart instead of line chart  
✅ Revenue-focused metrics (not scores)  
✅ Three time period views (Day, Week, Month)  
✅ Purple/teal gradient matching theme  
✅ Dollar values on top of bars  
✅ Interactive hover tooltip with detailed metrics  
✅ Removed comparison lines (Industry/Team Avg/Top Performer)  
✅ Dark theme consistency  
✅ Smooth transitions and animations  
✅ Responsive design for all screen sizes  

## Notes

- Currently using mock/sample data
- In production, you'll want to:
  - Replace mock data with actual revenue from database
  - Fetch data based on selected time period
  - Add loading states during data fetching
  - Consider caching for performance
  - Add error handling for failed data loads

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add date range picker for custom periods
- Export chart data to CSV/PDF
- Add comparison view (e.g., this month vs last month)
- Show revenue growth percentage
- Filter by specific team or region
- Add drill-down functionality to see individual sales
