## 🗣 Transcript 1 — Busy Mom, Ends Quickly (~45 seconds)

[Knock. Amanda opens the door while holding her phone.]

Amanda:
“Hi, sorry—make it quick, I’ve got dinner on the stove.”

Rep:
“Totally understand. I’m John with Legion Pest Control. We’re helping a few of your neighbors keep bugs out this season.”

Amanda:
“Mhm. We already had someone spray last spring, so we’re fine.”

Rep:
“Got it. If you see ants or wasps, we do free re-services between visits—”

Amanda:
“Yeah, I appreciate that, but I really gotta get back to cooking. Thanks though.”

Rep:
“No worries. Have a good evening.”

Amanda:
“Thanks, you too.”

✅ Training note: Amanda is polite but shuts it down quickly. Rep must practice concise openers.

## 🗣 Transcript 2 — Skeptical Homeowner, Pushback (~90 seconds)

Amanda:
“Hi there. You’re with…?”

Rep:
“I’m Mark with Legion Pest Control, working with your neighbors today.”

Amanda:
“Yeah, I’ve seen a lot of pest control folks around lately. What makes your company different?”

Rep:
“Good question. We offer—”

Amanda:
“Mhm. And is this a contract thing? Because I don’t like being locked in.”

Rep:
“Actually, we do quarterly service but no long-term contracts.”

Amanda:
“Okay, because last time we signed up for something like that, the guy disappeared after the first visit.”

Rep:
“I hear that a lot. We back ours up with unlimited re-services.”

Amanda:
“Hm. Well, maybe. I’d still need to talk to my husband. He’s the one who usually handles this stuff.”

✅ Training note: Amanda is cautious, asks about contracts, doesn’t say yes. Rep has to earn trust.

## 🗣 Transcript 3 — Friendly but Distracted (~2 minutes, natural rapport)

Amanda:
“Oh hey! What’s up?”

Rep:
“Hey there, I’m Josh with Legion Pest Control, just stopping by to meet some neighbors and let you know what we do.”

Amanda:
“Ah, okay. Amanda. Nice to meet you. You from around here?”

Rep:
“Yeah, actually live about 10 minutes away.”

Amanda:
“Nice. We’ve been here six years. Love the area, except my lawn’s a nightmare in July.”

Rep:
Laughs “Yeah, it gets brutal.”

Amanda:
“Oh—hang on. [yells offscreen] Mia, don’t climb on that! Sorry—kids.”

Rep:
“No worries. Happens all the time.”

Amanda:
“Anyway, you were saying—pest control?”

Rep:
“Exactly. We treat for ants, spiders, wasps—pretty much everything.”

Amanda:
“Yeah, the ants get bad in our kitchen. I had to put cinnamon on the counter last summer.”

Rep:
“Classic. We can knock that out easily.”

Amanda:
“Alright, tell me—ballpark, what does that usually run?”

Rep:
“Most homes are about $39 on the first visit, then quarterly service after.”

Amanda:
“Okay… not terrible. I’ll check with my husband. Do you have a card?”

Rep:
“Sure thing. Here you go.”

Amanda:
“Cool. Thanks for stopping by.”

✅ Training note: Rapport-heavy, with a life interruption. Amanda asks about pricing but doesn’t commit.

## 🗣 Transcript 4 — Positive Outcome, Books Service (~2.5 minutes)

Amanda:
“Hi there—who are you with?”

Rep:
“I’m Chris with Legion Pest Control. We’re working with a bunch of your neighbors today—actually just did the Johnsons across the street.”

Amanda:
“Oh really? Yeah, I know them. They always keep their yard perfect.”

Rep:
“Yep, they signed up this morning to take care of their wasps.”

Amanda:
“Ugh, don’t remind me. We had a nest under the deck last year, scared me half to death.”

Rep:
“Exactly what we handle. We do a full sweep and treat wasp nests on the spot.”

Amanda:
“Okay, that sounds useful. How often would you come?”

Rep:
“Quarterly, plus unlimited free re-services if you see anything in between.”

Amanda:
“Hmm… what’s the first visit cost?”

Rep:
“For homes like yours, $39 for the first, then it’s just quarterly after.”

Amanda:
“Honestly, that’s not bad. Can we set that up today, or do I need to call in?”

Rep:
“I can schedule you right now—it takes two minutes.”

Amanda:
“Alright, let’s do it. My husband will thank me if we never see another wasp.”

Rep:
“Perfect. I’ll just grab a little info.”

Amanda:
“Sure thing. Let’s get it done.”

✅ Training note: Amanda warms up, asks logical homeowner questions, and ends up signing.
