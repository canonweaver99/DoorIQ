# Achievement Email Notifications (Archived)

## Why Archived
Achievement emails were removed from active notifications to reduce email volume and focus on essential communications only.

## What Was Implemented

Achievement emails were automatically sent when users hit milestones:
- 🎯 First session completed
- 🔥 10 sessions completed
- 🏆 50 sessions completed
- ⭐ Score ≥ 95%
- 💰 First sale closed

## Code Location

The achievement detection logic is still available in:
- `lib/notifications/service.ts` - `detectAchievements()` function
- `lib/email/templates.ts` - `achievementEmail()` template

## To Re-enable

If you want to bring achievements back:

1. Uncomment the achievement notification block in `/app/api/grade/session/route.ts`
2. The template and detection logic are still in place
3. Test with a new session

## Alternative Implementation Ideas

Instead of email notifications, consider:
- In-app achievement badges/notifications
- Achievement display on dashboard
- Celebration animations in the UI
- Weekly digest emails that include achievements

## Email Template

See `achievement-email-template.html` in this directory for the archived template.
