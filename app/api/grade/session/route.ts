          OBJECTION HANDLING DEEP DIVE:
          Identify and analyze every objection or concern raised by the customer:
          
          For each objection:
          - Type: price, timing, competition, trust, need, authority, contract_length, chemical_concerns, pet_safety, previous_experience, rental_property, DIY_preference, other
          - Customer statement: exact quote expressing the objection
          - Rep response: how the rep responded
          - Technique used: what objection handling technique (feel_felt_found, reframing, isolation, social_proof, value_restatement, urgency, guarantee, trial_close, acknowledgment, none)
          - Resolution: "resolved" (customer satisfied), "partial" (addressed but not fully satisfied), "unresolved" (customer still has concern), or "ignored" (rep didn't address it)
          - Time to resolve: how long in MM:SS from objection to resolution
          - Effectiveness score: 0-100 on how well the objection was handled
          
          Also provide:
          - Total objections count
          - Unresolved concerns: array of concerns still not addressed
          - Objection patterns: brief summary of what customer is most concerned about
          
          PERSONALIZED COACHING PLAN:
          Based on the complete conversation analysis, create a personalized coaching plan:
          
          Immediate Fixes (2-4 items):
          - Issue: specific problem observed (e.g., "Long pauses during price discussion", "Weak trial closes", "Avoided objections")
          - Practice scenario: exact drill to practice (e.g., "Price confidence drill", "Assumptive close practice")
          - Resource link: training page URL (use format: /training/[topic] where topic is: price-objections, trial-closes, discovery-questions, objection-handling, rapport-building, closing-techniques, assumptive-language, active-listening)
          
          Skill Development (2-3 items):
          - Skill: specific skill to improve (e.g., "Trial closing", "Discovery questioning", "Objection isolation")
          - Current level: "beginner", "intermediate", or "advanced"
          - Target level: "intermediate" or "advanced"
          - Recommended exercises: array of 2-3 specific exercises (e.g., "assumptive close practice", "alternative choice close", "open-ended question drill")
          
          Role-Play Scenarios (2-4 items):
          - Array of specific scenarios to practice based on weaknesses
          - Examples: "Handle aggressive price negotiator", "Multi-stakeholder discovery", "Skeptical homeowner with trust issues", "Time-sensitive objection handling", "Pet safety concerns with anxious customer", "Convert DIY preference customer"
          
          Determine whether a return appointment or inspection was scheduled (return_appointment true/false).
          A sale counts as closed ONLY if the rep secured the deal at the door during this conversation. Scheduling a follow-up or inspection without payment is NOT a closed sale.
          If a sale is not closed, virtual_earnings must be 0 and sale_closed must be false.
          
          DYNAMIC EARNINGS CALCULATION:
          Extract the actual deal value from the conversation. Look for:
          - Price mentioned by rep ($99/month, $1200/year, $299 initial + $89/month, etc.)
          - Services sold (basic, standard, premium package)
          - Contract length (monthly, quarterly, annual, multi-year)
          - Payment terms and start dates
          
          Calculate earnings based on:
          - Base commission: 30% of total contract value
          - Bonus modifiers (add to commission):
            * quick_close: $25 if closed in under 15 minutes
            * upsell: $50 if sold premium/additional services beyond basic
            * retention: $30 if secured annual or multi-year contract (not just monthly)
            * same_day_start: $20 if customer agreed to start today or tomorrow
            * referral_secured: $25 if rep got referral/neighbor recommendation
            * perfect_pitch: $50 if overall_score >= 90
          
          For total contract value:
          - One-time: use that value
          - Monthly: price √ó contract_length (or √ó 12 if no length specified)
          - Annual: annual price √ó years (or √ó 1 if one-year)
