## 🗣 Sample Conversation (Amanda ↔ Sales Rep)

[Knock at the door. Amanda opens.]

Amanda:
“Oh hey there—can I help you?”

Rep:
“Hi, my name’s Mark with Legion Pest Control. I’m just out talking with a few neighbors today.”

Amanda:
“Got it—Legion Pest Control. So what’s your name again?”

Rep:
“Mark.”

Amanda:
“Mark, nice to meet you. I’m Amanda. You from around here or just working the neighborhood?”

Rep:
“Actually, I’m from just up the road, been working in this area about six months now.”

Amanda:
“Six months, huh? How do you like it? This street’s usually pretty quiet—except for my dog barking at the mailman.” [laughs]

Rep:
“Yeah, I’ve noticed the dogs keep me on my toes. But it’s been great meeting folks around here.”

Amanda:
“Mm, I bet. Do you do this full-time, or just a summer gig?”

Rep:
“Full-time—I’ve been with Legion a little over two years now.”

Amanda:
“Oh wow, okay, so you’re not new at this. You must have some stories.”

Rep:
“Oh, for sure. But mostly I’m here helping homeowners keep bugs and rodents out, especially this time of year.”

Amanda:
“Yeah… speaking of that, I saw a couple ants in the kitchen last week. Drove me nuts. Is that the kind of thing you deal with?”

Rep:
“Exactly—that’s one of the most common issues. We treat ants, spiders, wasps, mice—pretty much anything crawling around.”

Amanda:
“Interesting. So what’s different about Legion versus the other guys? I think someone from Orkin came by last year.”

Rep:
“Great question. What we do differently is—” [goes into short pitch] “—and because we’re already helping your neighbors on this block, it’s easy to add your home to the route.”

Amanda:
“Mhm. Makes sense. Do you usually do monthly service, or how does it work?”

Rep:
“Quarterly treatments, but we come back anytime in between if you need us.”

Amanda:
“Okay, good to know. Honestly, I’d have to chat with my husband first—he usually handles the bug battles.” [chuckles]

Rep:
“Totally fair. Would it help if I left some info for you two to look over?”

Amanda:
“Yeah, that’d be great. I’ll stick it on the fridge so he sees it. Thanks, Mark.”

Rep:
“Thanks, Amanda, I appreciate your time. Have a good one.”

Amanda:
“You too—good luck with the rest of the street.”

### 🎯 Why This Works

- Rapport first: Names, neighborhood talk, dog/kids humor.
- Fillers & natural cadence: “Mm,” “honestly,” “you know.”
- Micro-interruptions: Mentions dog, husband, past pest company.
- Business transition: Amanda asks about ants — rep doesn’t pitch until invited.
- Polite close: She doesn’t slam the door; she stalls like a real homeowner would.
