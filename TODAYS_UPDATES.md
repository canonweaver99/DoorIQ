# DoorIQ Updates - October 6, 2025

## 🎉 Major Features Implemented Today

### 1. ✅ Virtual Money Capture System
**Status:** Fully implemented and working

**What it does:**
- When you close a deal during practice (quote price + get agreement), you earn virtual money
- Money automatically added to your account via database trigger
- Green money notification shows your earnings ($299, $89, etc.)
- Leaderboard updates automatically with your total earnings

**Files changed:**
- `lib/supabase/migrations/011_add_virtual_earnings_to_live_sessions.sql`
- `lib/supabase/database.types.ts`
- `app/api/sessions/end/route.ts`
- `app/trainer/page.tsx`

---

### 2. 🤖 AI Grading System Fixed
**Status:** Working (with database migration required)

**What was broken:**
- OpenAI returned decimal scores (36.67) but database expected integers ❌
- Database constraints required scores ≥ 1, but OpenAI returns 0 for non-applicable categories ❌

**What we fixed:**
- Round all scores to integers before saving ✅
- Allow 0 scores (changed constraint from 1-100 to 0-100) ✅
- Store original decimal scores in `analytics` JSON field ✅

**Files changed:**
- `app/api/grade/session/route.ts`
- `lib/supabase/migrations/012_relax_score_constraints.sql`

**⚠️ REQUIRES DATABASE MIGRATION:**
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- Copy from: lib/supabase/migrations/012_relax_score_constraints.sql
```

### 3. ⚡ Background Grading (Instant Analytics)
**Status:** Implemented

**Before:** Session ends → Wait 13 seconds → See analytics 😴  
**Now:** Session ends → **Instant redirect** → Scores populate in background ⚡

**How it works:**
1. Session saves transcript immediately
2. Grading runs in background (fire-and-forget)
3. User sees analytics page instantly
4. Page polls every 2 seconds for grading completion
5. Scores appear within ~10-15 seconds

**Files changed:**
- `app/api/sessions/end/route.ts`
- `app/trainer/page.tsx`
- `app/trainer/analytics/[sessionId]/page.tsx`

### 5. 💬 Improved AI Coach

### 7. 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Fixed text clipping on "Challenge" heading
- The 'g' in "Challenge" was being cut off
- Added proper padding for gradient text

#### Fixed session ID corruption (UPDATED Oct 6)
- **Root cause**: UUIDs with hex patterns like `18`, `1b`, `60` were being interpreted as escape sequences
- **Example**: `181b1c1f...360cb` was corrupted to `1B1b1c1f...3d0cb` (404 error)
- **Fix**: Now explicitly URL-encode session IDs before navigation
- **Fix**: Analytics page decodes the session ID before fetching
- Added sanitization to strip invalid characters
- Fixed 404 errors when navigating to analytics
- **Files changed**: `app/trainer/page.tsx`, `app/trainer/analytics/[sessionId]/page.tsx`

#### Fixed AuthSessionMissingError
- Analytics page now uses API route instead of client-side Supabase
- Bypasses RLS and auth issues
